# Emphasis Formatting Policy (Essay)

Goal: use emphasis for scanability/re-findability, not rhetorical punch. Emphasis should be deliberate and rare.

## Emphasis budget
- Bold: max 1 bold instance per paragraph.
- Italics: max 1 italic instance per paragraph.
- Exceptions: diagnostic/checklist blocks with line-start labels; glossary-style definition lists; titles/foreign terms do not count toward italic budget.
- Never bold/italicize full sentences, long clauses, or multiple fragments in one paragraph.
- If emphasis seems needed more than once, rewrite or restructure instead of adding more emphasis.

## Bold is only for
- First definition of a program term (first formal intro in a section/chapter).
- Named rules/tests/constraints as labels, formatted **Label:** followed by plain text.
- Short lead-in labels inside a paragraph when it improves scanning (few words): **Failure mode:** **Objective:**

Do not use bold for general emphasis or tone.

## Italics are only for
- Titles of books/essays.
- Foreign or technical terms on first use (especially when glossed).
- Very light emphasis only when absolutely necessary (rare).

Do not use italics to repeatedly highlight program terms after first use.

## Consistency rules
- If a term is bolded on first definition, do not re-bold unless reintroduced after long absence or defining a distinct variant.
- Rule/test labels always use **Label:** then plain text.
- Titles always italic.
- Foreign terms italic on first use; plain thereafter.

## Allowed exceptions
- Diagnostic blocks/equations/variable lists: bold for line-start labels only.
- Glossary-like passages: bold the term at the start of each definition line, not in sentences.

## Decision test
Emphasis is warranted only if it helps a reader:
- Locate a concept later by skimming, or
- Recognize a formal definition/rule/diagnostic.

Otherwise, keep it plain.
