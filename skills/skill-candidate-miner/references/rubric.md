# Skill Candidate Rubric

Use this rubric to decide whether a repeated pattern should become a skill.

## Strong candidates
- Repeated multi-step workflows (3+ steps) that appear across sessions.
- Tasks that require strict formatting rules or policies.
- Tasks that require consistent tool usage or file conventions.
- Frequent use of the same scripts or command sequences.
- Requests that require specialized domain context or reference docs.

## Weak candidates
- One-off edits or novelty requests.
- Generic tasks with no project-specific constraints.
- Tasks already handled well by global, general-purpose behavior.

## Output expectations
When proposing a skill, include:
- Proposed skill name (kebab-case).
- Trigger description (what user says that should invoke it).
- Core workflow (3–7 steps).
- Suggested resources (scripts/references/assets) to include.

## Deduping
- Scan existing skills first.
- If a candidate overlaps an existing skill, propose an update/extension instead of a new skill.
- Only propose new skills when the workflow or domain is distinct.

## Privacy/Scope
- Do not quote sensitive content from logs.
- Summarize and aggregate; prefer counts and file/command patterns.
- If unsure about privacy, ask before inspecting logs.
