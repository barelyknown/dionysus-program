## About the Program

::: about-program
Knowledge now melts faster than organizations can re-bind it into identity, norms, and operating systems—without depleting trust. AI compresses the half-life of expertise; what took decades now happens in quarters. Under that pressure, the primary obstacle to progress is no longer technical—it's cultural. Teams hit their limits not because they can't think, but because they can't digest disruptive reality into new roles, new norms, and new commitments without collapsing into numbness, scapegoating, or management theater.

The *Dionysus Program* is a field manual for leaders facing that bottleneck. Written by Sean Devine, founder and CEO of XBE.

It argues for a new scoreboard: **epimetabolic rate**—the speed at which a person, team, or organization converts error into new structure without burning its social fabric. The method is a loop you can actually run: critique → dissolution → reconstitution → renewal. Not "more candor" stapled onto an unchanged culture, but an operating system where knowledge-updating becomes cheaper, safer, and more productive over time—so you can move fast, break things, and then mend what you break into something stronger.

The program is built around a deliberate toggle between two modes:

* **Run Time**: ordinary operations—execution, decisions, outcomes, accountability to plans.
* **Ritual Time**: protected containers where the work is metabolizing loss—where performance scoring pauses and the group becomes accountable to the rite: non-violent rules, reason-giving, and the standing right of criticism.

This distinction is the heart of the book. Most organizations either stay in Run Time until reality forces a catastrophic break, or they perform Ritual Time and get theater. The *Dionysus Program* shows how to build Ritual Time that can hold real heat without harm: concentrating conflict onto shared objects instead of people, designing beauty and hospitality so disruptive knowledge is bearable, and practicing tragedy so losses teach instead of traumatize.

What makes this unusually usable is that it isn't just an essay. It's a toolset with interlocking parts:

* **The Epimetabolic Equation**: a mathematical model that turns culture into dynamics—linking trust, ritual capacity, stewardship integrity, beauty, and melt into explicit failure modes and a single diagnostic: how much structure you gain per unit of trust you burn.
* **The One-Man Job**: a diagnosis of why trust is harder to accumulate when AI collapses the division of labor and distributed work eliminates proximity—and practical guidance on generating *Ren* (the density of trust and shared history that makes high-heat rituals safe) deliberately through play, mission commitment, and hiring for relational density.
* **The Impatience of Jobs**: the hard case—how to compress relational time through boundary, ordeal, and complicity when Ren must form in quarters rather than decades, without turning necessity into cult.
* **The Alchemy of Error**: why organizational truth requires both public rigor and a protected human container.
* **The Alchemist's Assay**: a diagnostic lens that distinguishes true transformation from false alchemy.
* **Crimes Against Ren**: a penal code for breaches of the container—atimia, exile, and restoration—so enforcement protects the rites without scapegoating.
* **Archetypes of Organizational Fate**: a taxonomy of recognizable end-states (thriving, pyrrhic victories, declines, collapses) you can name early, diagnose accurately, and intervene on while change is still possible.
* **The Interactive Simulation**: a web-based companion that lets you manipulate the model and watch trajectories unfold—so small parameter changes become legible before they harden into fate.
* **Letters to the Editor**: dramatized critiques from rival traditions and "ghost advisors," stress-testing the program the way the program demands: by standing in public under intelligent opposition.

If you're looking for tactics that preserve your current identity while the world changes around you, this won't satisfy. But if you want a rigorous way to face disruptive knowledge—and come out stronger on the other side—the *Dionysus Program* is a set of rites for renewal you can actually run.

The world is not going to slow down for us. So we will have to become the kind of people who can keep up—without becoming less human.
