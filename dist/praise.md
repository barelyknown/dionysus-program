> Antifragility is the ability to pull adaptation forward in time and within your organization, so that natural selection happens within you (on your beliefs, sub-components, and processes) rather than upon you. For this to happen, an organization needs, on the one hand, to proactively convert problems into change, and on the other hand, to do so without changing more than it can absorb, and without making change the end rather than the means. In this context, Sean suggests a possible way forward: a barbelled cycle of critique, dissolution, reconstitution, and renewal, which he calls the Dionysus Program.

> The Dionysus Program is not about technology—it’s about the human systems required to survive accelerated change. By removing obstacles and enabling shared purpose as constraints fall away, it provides a framework for constant adaptability without organizational fracture. Required reading for leaders building resilience in a fast-moving world.

> Most leadership books are trying to impress you. A few are trying to help you. Very few feel like they’re genuinely in service of leaders and the people they lead.
> 
> The Dionysus Program does.
> 
> This is a dense book, in the best possible way. Sean doesn’t spoon-feed ideas or flatten them for easy consumption. He breaks down powerful concepts, shows you where they come from, and gives you the tools to go deeper. To think. To wrestle. To apply what you’re learning in ways that actually fit your organization.
> 
> Sean is deeply committed to people, and just as deeply committed to growth. He refuses the tradeoff most leaders quietly accept. The idea that you can either push forward or take care of the humans involved, but not both.
> 
> That refusal shows up throughout the book. In conversations with Sean around these ideas, and while reading The Dionysus Program, I found myself sitting with uncomfortable questions and reexamining assumptions I didn’t realize I was carrying. Pushing back and being heard. Not because Sean’s goal is to convince, but because he is genuinely committed to discovering what allows people and organizations to grow together.
> 
> Despite being one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, what stands out most is his commitment to growth itself. Not growth as performance or scale, but growth as learning, relationship, and capacity. That commitment makes room for something rare. Deep trust and real progress at the same time.
> 
> This book doesn’t treat leadership as a performance or culture as a vibe. It treats them as capacities that can be built and returned to as the world changes and the pressure rises.
> 
> For me, this book is a gift. It offers real hope in the age of AI. Not that change will slow down, but that humans don’t have to be left behind. That we can learn and create together in ways that are deeper and more meaningful than what came before.
> 
> In the end, it speaks to the question I keep coming back to:
> 
> How do I keep getting better, with the people I care most about?
