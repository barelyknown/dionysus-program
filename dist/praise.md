> Antifragility is the ability to pull adaptation forward in time and within your organization, so that natural selection happens within you (on your beliefs, sub-components, and processes) rather than upon you. For this to happen, an organization needs, on the one hand, to proactively convert problems into change, and on the other hand, to do so without changing more than it can absorb, and without making change the end rather than the means. In this context, Sean suggests a possible way forward: a barbelled cycle of critique, dissolution, reconstitution, and renewal, which he calls the Dionysus Program.

> The Dionysus Program is not about technology—it’s about the human systems required to survive accelerated change. By removing obstacles and enabling shared purpose as constraints fall away, it provides a framework for constant adaptability without organizational fracture. Required reading for leaders building resilience in a fast-moving world.
