<blockquote>
<p>Antifragility is the ability to pull adaptation forward in time and
within your organization, so that natural selection happens within you
(on your beliefs, sub-components, and processes) rather than upon you.
For this to happen, an organization needs, on the one hand, to
proactively convert problems into change, and on the other hand, to do
so without changing more than it can absorb, and without making change
the end rather than the means. In this context, Sean suggests a possible
way forward: a barbelled cycle of critique, dissolution, reconstitution,
and renewal, which he calls the Dionysus Program.</p>

<p>The Dionysus Program is not about technology—it’s about the human
systems required to survive accelerated change. By removing obstacles
and enabling shared purpose as constraints fall away, it provides a
framework for constant adaptability without organizational fracture.
Required reading for leaders building resilience in a fast-moving
world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most leadership books are trying to impress you. A few are trying to
help you. Very few feel like they’re genuinely in service of leaders and
the people they lead.</p>
<p>The Dionysus Program does.</p>
<p>This is a dense book, in the best possible way. Sean doesn’t
spoon-feed ideas or flatten them for easy consumption. He breaks down
powerful concepts, shows you where they come from, and gives you the
tools to go deeper. To think. To wrestle. To apply what you’re learning
in ways that actually fit your organization.</p>
<p>Sean is deeply committed to people, and just as deeply committed to
growth. He refuses the tradeoff most leaders quietly accept. The idea
that you can either push forward or take care of the humans involved,
but not both.</p>
<p>That refusal shows up throughout the book. In conversations with Sean
around these ideas, and while reading The Dionysus Program, I found
myself sitting with uncomfortable questions and reexamining assumptions
I didn’t realize I was carrying. Pushing back and being heard. Not
because Sean’s goal is to convince, but because he is genuinely
committed to discovering what allows people and organizations to grow
together.</p>
<p>Despite being one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, what stands
out most is his commitment to growth itself. Not growth as performance
or scale, but growth as learning, relationship, and capacity. That
commitment makes room for something rare. Deep trust and real progress
at the same time.</p>
<p>This book doesn’t treat leadership as a performance or culture as a
vibe. It treats them as capacities that can be built and returned to as
the world changes and the pressure rises.</p>
<p>For me, this book is a gift. It offers real hope in the age of AI.
Not that change will slow down, but that humans don’t have to be left
behind. That we can learn and create together in ways that are deeper
and more meaningful than what came before.</p>
<p>In the end, it speaks to the question I keep coming back to:</p>
<p>How do I keep getting better, with the people I care most about?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just back from the XBE customer success retreat in Goa, and I spent
this weekend reading The Dionysus Program. Eight months into my first
job out of college, this book gave me language for something I witnessed
but couldn’t name.</p>
<p>There’s this moment at sunset on a Goa beach where the light shifts
and the entire shoreline reveals shapes you walked past all day without
seeing. Reading about epimetabolic rate felt like that sudden clarity.
Most organizations collect insights like shells on a beach. They stack
them up, admire them, never actually burn them for fuel. The difference
between teams that adapt and teams that stagnate comes down to how fast
you can take what broke yesterday and let it reshape how you work
today.</p>
<p>The beauty concept landed differently after Goa. Sean argues
aesthetics create the conditions for examining difficult truths. The
ocean and the unhurried meals gave us space for conversations that would
have died in a conference room under fluorescent lights. Beauty doesn’t
make hard thinking pleasant. It makes hard thinking possible.</p>
<p>What keeps coming back is putting systems on trial instead of people.
Imagine pointing all your critical energy at the process itself. The
playbook becomes the defendant. The metric goes on the stand. Everyone
gets to help prosecute what’s broken instead of protecting themselves
from blame. That completely transforms conflict from something you
survive into something generative.</p>
<p>I’m early enough in my career that I’m watching how organizations
actually learn versus how they say they learn. The gap is enormous. This
book explained the mechanics of that gap and gave me real tools to close
it.</p>
