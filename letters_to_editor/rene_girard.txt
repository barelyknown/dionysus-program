To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I have read your manual with the specific attention one grants to a mirror that reflects a familiar face, but with the eyes arranged in a startling new configuration. You have cited my work on the mimetic mechanism and the scapegoat, and for this I must offer you a correction that is also a warning.

You have correctly identified the fundamental problem of human organization, which is not resource scarcity or technical incompetence, but the management of internal violence generated by mimetic desire. You understand that as we imitate one another, we inevitably desire the same objects—status, recognition, "the roadmap," "the strategy"—and that this convergence leads to a rivalry that can only be resolved by the unanimity of expulsion. In the archaic world, we solved this by killing a victim. You propose to solve it by killing a document.

You call this the "anti-scapegoat." You suggest that a group can achieve the catharsis of the violent mob by directing its fury toward a "charter" or an "assumption" rather than a person. This is a fascinating anthropological gamble.

My hesitation is this: the power of the sacrificial mechanism lies in its deception. The mob must believe the victim is truly guilty, truly the cause of the disorder, for the peace of the community to be restored. The victim must bleed. Can a PDF bleed? Can a "metric" suffer? If the object you place in the center cannot truly absorb the sins of the community because it cannot feel pain, will the community actually feel cleansed? Or will they leave your ritual container with their resentment intact, only to discharge it later in the parking lot or the private chat?

You are attempting to construct a sacrificial machine without a victim. You are trying to trick the mechanism of the sacred into operating on an inanimate object. It is the dream of the modern world to have the benefits of religion—the binding force, the peace, the renewal—without the cost of the sacrifice.

However, I admire your "Cincinnatus Rule" and your fear of the "ritual oligarchy." You have correctly seen that the priest who manages the sacrifice eventually becomes a king, and that this kingship is dangerous. By forcing the priest to return to the plow, you attempt to prevent the sacred from hardening into a permanent tyranny. This is wise.

You have named your program for Dionysus. This is a dangerous name. Nietzsche loved Dionysus because he saw in him the ecstatic unity of the crowd. I have always reminded my readers that the Dionysian crowd is a lynch mob. When the boundaries dissolve and the "self becomes its object," as you say, the result is usually a pile of bodies. You believe you can contain Dionysus in a "Crossing." I hope you are right. If you fail, you will find that the god of the melt is not easily put back into the bottle, and he will demand a real victim, not a "hard-to-vary explanation."

You are attempting to domesticate the founding murder. It is a terrifying and necessary engineering project.
