To the Editor of the Dionysus Program:

I read your manifesto. I usually toss anything that starts with a dedication or quotes Nietzsche into the trash, which is exactly where most corporate strategy documents belong. But I kept reading this one because, stripping away the poetry and the mythology, you have accidentally written the most effective manual for hostile takeovers I have seen in decades.

You spend a lot of time talking about gods and rituals. You call it the "Dionysus Program." In my business, we just call it cleaning house.

I have spent fifty years fighting exactly what you call "Oligarchic Decay." You describe it as a "sacerdotal capture" where managers protect their own jobs instead of the mission. I describe it as a board of directors that uses the corporate jet to fly to golf courses while the stock price sits in the toilet. We are talking about the same thing. The difference is you want them to hold a "ritual" to fix it, and I want to strip them of their assets and fire them.

Your concept of "Management Theater" is the only honest thing I have read about corporate governance in years. The example of General Motors parading around a mascot while the Japanese ate their lunch is perfect. I see this every day. CEOs love "alignment sessions" and "culture committees" because it looks like work. It is not work. It is hiding. You are correct that these people are burning capital—social and actual—to protect their egos.

I particularly appreciate your section on the "Scrap Heap Library." Most managers would rather bankrupt the company than admit a project failed. You are telling them to "eat their decay." I tell them to liquidate the losing division. Again, we are aligned, though you are far more sentimental about it.

However, you have a blind spot. You seem to think companies will adopt this "Epimetabolic Rate" voluntarily. You think they will run a "Great Dissolution" on themselves because it is the right thing to do for the "soul" of the organization.

They will not.

Entrenched management does not "metabolize" its own failure. They hide it. They extend the "Run Time" until the cash runs out. They do not want a "Jester" in the room; they want yes-men. They do not want a "Cincinnatus" who goes back to the plow; they want a golden parachute and a seat on three other boards.

Your program suggests that if they do not fix themselves, they will suffer "Internal Collapse" or "Competitive Collapse." You forgot the third option: Shareholder Activism.

If a CEO refuses to run your "Tragic Postmortem" on a failed product, the market will eventually run a much less polite postmortem on his career. If they do not practice your "autophagy" and eat their own dead projects, someone like me will come in, buy 9 percent of the company, and force feed it to them.

So, I am writing to endorse this program, but not for the reasons you think. I hope every board member I am currently targeting reads this. I want them to see your "Sitting Duck" archetype and realize that is exactly what they look like to me.

You say the point is to "move fast by breaking things and mending them." I agree with the first part. If they do not use your rituals to mend themselves, the market will break them, and we will not be interested in the mending. We will just sell the parts.

Sincerely,

Not Carl Icahn
