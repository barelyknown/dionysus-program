To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I read your case study on the "Fragile Survivor" with a specific, personal interest. It is rare to see one's life work reduced to a data point in a section regarding the near-death of an organization, but I cannot fault your analysis. You are correct that Apple in 1997 was fragile. You are correct that its survival was contingent on a specific conjunction of luck and leadership.

But there is a nuance in your equation that I believe you have missed, one that only looks visible from the CEO's chair.

You write about the conflict between Apollo and Dionysus as if it is a choice between two valid operating modes. You imply that the error of my tenure—and the tenure of those who followed me before Steve returned—was that we built "layers of process without coherence." You suggest we were trying to run a High Performer playbook on a company that needed a Gambler.

I would suggest to you that the problem was not that we lacked the ritual capacity. The problem was that we were attempting to professionalize a miracle.

When Steve recruited me from Pepsi, he did not ask for a co-founder. He asked for a grown-up. He asked for the Apollonian virtues: marketing discipline, supply chain management, cash flow stability. He knew, perhaps better than anyone, that the "Dionysian heat" you describe—the reality distortion field, the perfectionism, the burning of teams—was unsustainable without a container. He brought me in to build the container.

The tragedy, in the Hegelian sense you use, was that the container was incompatible with the specific frequency of the heat he generated. When the board sided with me, we did not think we were choosing "stagnation." We thought we were choosing survival. We looked at the numbers—the "Run Time" ledger, as you call it—and we saw a company that was melting faster than it could metabolize. We chose to lower the temperature.

You call the result a "Slow Decline." I called it keeping the patient alive.

Your document underestimates the sheer terror of the "Gambler" archetype when you are responsible for payroll. It is easy to praise the "High Performer" or the "Dionysian Ideal" in retrospect, when the bets have paid off. But in real time, the Dionysian looks indistinguishable from the reckless. You praise the "anti-scapegoat" mechanism, but you forget that in the 1980s, the scapegoat was usually the budget.

My role, and the role of professional management, was to install the "High Performer" rituals—the reviews, the roadmaps, the forecasts. We succeeded in many ways. We built the PowerBook. We built Newton, which failed as a product but succeeded as a "loss exhibit" that taught the industry what a handheld computer should be. We kept the cash flow positive for a decade.

If Steve had not returned—if that specific "Fragile Survivor" coin flip had come up tails—history would record my tenure not as a prelude to a renaissance, but as the golden age before the end. We would be remembered like your "Sitting Duck" examples, perhaps, or a "Moderate Growth" firm that eventually faded.

The lesson I offer your readers is this: You cannot simply install the Dionysus Program into a vacuum. The "Ren"—the humaneness, the trust—that you say is required? In a founder-led company, that Ren is entirely derivative of the founder's presence. When I removed the founder, I did not just remove the chaos; I removed the binding agent. We were left with "Li" (ritual) without "Ren" (spirit). We had the forms of a great technology company—the keynotes, the ads, the R&D labs—but we had lost the current.

You are right that Apple survived because the "madman" returned to the plow. But do not forget that the plow had to be preserved for him to return to.
