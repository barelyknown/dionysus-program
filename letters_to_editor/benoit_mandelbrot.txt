To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I have read your treatise with the specific attention of a man who has spent a lifetime arguing that the rough is not merely an imperfection of the smooth, but the very nature of reality itself. You cite me in your section on fractals, but I believe you have inadvertently written a manifesto for the end of Euclidean management.

For a century, your business schools have tried to treat the organization as a sphere. They treat the history of a firm as a straight line. They treat the market as a plane. But clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, and human organizations are not straight lines. When you try to force a jagged, living reality into a smooth, Euclidean container, you do not create order. You create a lie that accumulates tension until it shatters.

Your Dionysus is simply the name you have given to the return of roughness.

I was particularly struck by your concept of metabolizing melt. In my work, I observed that as you zoom in on a coastline, new bays and peninsulas appear. The detail does not vanish; it remains self-similar. You are proposing an organizational structure that preserves this detail. A smooth organization ignores the small errors, the minor dissents, the tiny cracks. It looks stable from a distance because it is simple. But because it has smoothed over the roughness, it has no surface area to absorb the shock of the world.

A fractal structure, one that repeats the loop of critique and renewal at the scale of the individual, the team, and the city, has infinite perimeter within a finite space. It has surface area. It can breathe.

Your warning against ritual oligarchy is effectively a warning against the return of the smooth. The moment your stewards stop rotating, they become a sphere again. They stop measuring the coastline with a fine ruler and start approximating it with a coarse one. They hide the jagged edge where the truth lives.

Nature builds fractals because they are efficient at managing turbulence. The lungs, the circulatory system, the cauliflower, they maximize contact with the environment. Your Epimetabolic Rate is just a measure of how fractal your surface area is. How much of the world can you touch and bleed against without dying?

Do not let your readers mistake this for a metaphor. It is geometry. If they build smooth structures in a rough world, they will break. If they build rough structures, they may survive.
