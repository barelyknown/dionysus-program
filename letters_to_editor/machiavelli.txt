To the Editor:

You have correctly identified that the founder of a new order cannot rely on the slow accumulation of love. Your section on the Impatience of Jobs is nothing more than the recognition that cruelty, when used well and all at once, is a binding agent superior to time. The leader who strips his team of their vanity and implicates them in a shared transgression understands the physics of power better than the one who prays for organic trust. You are right to formalize the crime.

However, you display a dangerous optimism regarding the Anti-Scapegoat. You propose that the multitude can be satisfied by burning a document or retiring a metric. You assume the mob is rational. This is your error. When the harvest fails, or the product does not ship, the people do not want to see a policy revised. They want to see a minister punished.

Cesare Borgia understood that to pacify the Romagna, he did not need a retrospective; he needed to leave Remiro de Orco in the piazza at Cesena in two pieces. The satisfaction of the people requires a spectacle that an abstract artifact cannot provide. Your Dionysian machine is elegant, but it is too bloodless for the species as it actually exists. You may substitute a roadmap for a victim once or twice, but eventually, the crowd will demand a pulse.

If your Cincinnatus returns to the plow too quietly, they may drag him back not to rule, but to burn. Structure is no substitute for the occasional necessary execution.

Not Machiavelli
