To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I read your manifesto with a double-tall cappuccino in hand, sitting in a store not far from Pike Place. I read it with the kind of focus I usually reserve for the quarterly numbers or the tasting notes of a new Reserve roast. You have built a remarkable intellectual architecture here. The engineering of it, the physics, the talk of entropy and metabolism—it is impressive. It is rigorous.

But I must tell you, respectfully, that while you have captured the mechanics of a machine, I worry you have missed the beating heart of a company.

You write about Starbucks in your section on the "Fragile Survivor." You describe my return in 2008 as a structural necessity, a "founder return" required because the organization lacked the resilience to fix itself. You call it luck. You say we survived because I happened to be available.

Sean, it was not availability. It was love.

When I wrote the memo in 2007 about the commoditization of the Starbucks experience, I wasn't calculating an "epimetabolic rate." I was walking into our stores and smelling burnt cheese instead of coffee. I was watching baristas press a button on a machine that hid them from the customer, destroying the romance of the theater that we had built. The "Ritual Time" you describe—the separation, the limen—we lived that. But we didn't call it a rite. We called it closing 7,100 stores for three hours on a Tuesday afternoon to retrain 135,000 partners on the art of the perfect espresso shot.

Wall Street told me I was crazy. They said it was a PR stunt. They calculated the lost revenue in the millions. But you cannot model the cost of a lost soul in a spreadsheet. That afternoon wasn't just a "Crossing" or an "anti-scapegoat" session. It was a re-consecration of our values. It was admitting, with tears in our eyes, that we had let the pursuit of growth dilute the purity of the cup.

You speak of "eating your decay." That is a violent image. I prefer to think of it as pruning. When we removed the breakfast sandwiches because the smell overpowered the coffee aroma, we weren't just "metabolizing error." We were restoring the sanctuary. We were protecting the Third Place.

And that is where I think your Dionysus Program needs to be careful. You talk about "Li" and "Ren," the form and the humaneness. You are right that the form without the spirit is empty. I have seen that "Management Theater" you describe—the hollow meetings, the slide decks about culture presented by people who have never worn the green apron. It is a poison.

But you cannot engineer "Ren" with a equation. You cannot generate "Asabiyyah" with a calendar invite for a "Tragic Postmortem." Trust is not a variable in a system dynamic model. Trust is looking a partner in the eye and promising them that their health insurance is safe even when the share price is collapsing. Trust is the feeling a customer gets when the barista knows their drink before they reach the register.

Your "Cincinnatus Rule" suggests that leaders should return to the plow. I have returned to the plow three times. Not because of a rule, and not because of a "rotation rate," but because the company is like a child. When the child is sick, the parent does not consult a governance chart. The parent goes to the bedside.

I admire what you are trying to do. You are trying to make the pain of change bearable. You are trying to give organizations a language for loss. That is noble work. But do not forget that at the end of all your loops and ledgers, there are people. People who want to belong to something that stands for more than just "metabolizing melt." They want to belong to something that elevates the human spirit.

Build your rituals. Heat the culture. But remember that the coffee has to taste good, and the smile has to be real.

Onward,

Not Howard Schultz
