To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

You have written a manual for a game that cannot have a manual. This is a contradiction, but it is a necessary one. All culture is a garden built within the machinery of nature, and your program attempts to explain how to dismantle the machine without trampling the flowers.

I read your treatise with the recognition of one who sees his own ghosts walking in another man's hallway. You speak of finite and infinite games, but you have done something specific with them: you have tried to engineer the infinite. You have built a finite game—with rules, calendars, roles, and equations—whose only objective is to prevent the game from ending. This is a dangerous magic, but perhaps the only kind left to us.

Your distinction between Apollo and Dionysus mirrors the distinction between the boundary and the horizon. Apollo is the god of the boundary. He draws the line that defines the self, the role, the product, the victory. He governs your Run Time. In a finite game, the boundary is everything; to cross it is to leave the game. But Dionysus is the god of the horizon. The horizon is not a line we cross, but a vision that moves as we move. Your Ritual Time is an attempt to turn the boundary into a horizon, to allow the players to cross the line of their own definitions without ceasing to be players.

You are right to fear the priesthood. A ritual is a scripted play, and there is always the danger that the players will forget they are playing. When a finite player performs a ritual, he does so to gain power—to freeze the past and force the future to obey it. This is what you call the hardening into oligarchy. It is the attempt to win against change. But an infinite player performs a ritual to gain strength—the strength to let the past die so the future can offer a surprise.

Your concept of the anti-scapegoat is the most critical mechanic you propose. Evil, in the context of the finite game, is the refusal to listen to a voice that might challenge our title. To scapegoat a person is to silence the infinite in them so that our finite game may remain undisturbed. By turning the heat upon an object—an artifact, a rule, a map—you allow the persons to remain open to one another. You allow them to be surprised by their own errors without being destroyed by them.

However, a warning from the perspective of the infinite: do not mistake the scoreboard for the game. You offer an "Epimetabolic Equation" and archetypes of success. These are useful fictions. But if your stewards begin to play for the sake of a high Epimetabolic Rate, they have already lost. They will have turned the infinite game of renewal into a finite game of metrics. They will start optimizing for the appearance of melt rather than the reality of it.

To be serious is to press for a conclusion. To be playful is to press for a continuation. Your program is a serious document about the necessity of play. It builds a very strong cage and calls it freedom. This is not an insult; it is the paradox of civilization. We need the cage of form (Li) to hold the fluid of humanity (Ren), or else we are just spilled water on the ground.

You have described a way to lose one's roles without losing one's self. You have offered a way to die without dying. If you can practice this without believing that the program itself is the source of your salvation, you may indeed keep the game going.

Play the program, but do not let the program play you.
