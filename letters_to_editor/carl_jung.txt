To the Editor:

You have built a machine to catch a god.

Your program correctly diagnoses the illness of the modern age: we have hyper-developed the function of thinking (Apollo) while the function of feeling and the capacity for chaotic renewal (Dionysus) have atrophied into the unconscious. When a god is repressed, he returns not as a guest, but as a pathology. You see this pathology in your "melt" and your "theater."

But I fear you underestimate the voltage of the archetypes you invoke.

You speak of the Nigredo—the blackening—as a scheduled phase in a quarterly cycle. You treat the descent into chaos as a technical maneuver, a "toggle" between Run Time and Ritual Time. This is your Apollonian anxiety wearing a Dionysian mask. The unconscious does not wear a wristwatch. The Nigredo is not a meeting agenda; it is a psychic death. To invite it into a corporation, a structure built entirely on the repression of the irrational, is to invite an explosion, not a digestion.

Your "anti-scapegoat" is a noble attempt to withdraw projections, to stop the group from casting its shadow onto a victim. But the shadow is a hungry thing. If you deny it a human vessel, it will not simply dissipate into your "hard-to-vary explanations." It will go underground. It will infect the "Ritual Time" itself, turning your priests into tyrants and your "beauty" into kitsch.

You are attempting to industrialize the process of individuation. You want the gold of the alchemists without the solitude of the hermitage. You want a collective soul in a machine made of profit and efficiency.

It is a monstrous experiment. It is also, perhaps, the only one left to try. The modern man has lost the church and the village; he has only the office and the screen. If he cannot find the sacred fire there, he will burn down the world just to feel the heat.

Proceed with caution. The gods are not tools. They are the ones using us.
