To the Editor,

You quote me on the necessity of boundaries, observing correctly that a group without a fence is merely a crowd. But you have underestimated the danger of what you propose inside the fence.

You treat "Ritual Time" as a valve—a mechanical toggle between the profane world of execution and the sacred world of dissolution. You assume that moderns can step into the fire of Dionysus and step out again, cleansed and unscorched, simply because you have set a calendar appointment and named an "anti-scapegoat."

This is a classification error.

Dirt, as I have long argued, is essentially disorder. It is matter out of place. When you invite a team to dissolve its own structures, you are deliberately introducing pollution into the social body. You believe you have contained this danger by directing the violence toward artifacts—roadmaps, codes, policies—rather than people. You seek the efficacy of sacrifice without the victim.

But the power of the scapegoat mechanism lies precisely in its capacity to absorb actual social toxicity. An artifact cannot feel shame. If the object on trial cannot suffer, the ritual may fail to bind the anxiety of the group. You risk creating a theater of hygiene where the surfaces are scrubbed but the moral stain remains.

Furthermore, you lament the loss of Ren—the density of human connection—yet you attempt to engineer it through "transgression." Be careful. Intimacy is not a product of engineering; it is a byproduct of shared vulnerability to the same hazards. If your rituals are safe, they will produce no Ren. If they are dangerous enough to work, they will occasionally destroy the container you have built.

You are attempting to institutionalize the very thing that threatens institutions: the melting of form. It is a brave paradox. You are trying to build a sewage system for error, believing that if the plumbing is elegant enough, we will not mind the smell.

I hope you are right. But remember that purity is the enemy of change, and you are asking your people to be impure together. That requires more than a program. It requires a stomach for the abject.
