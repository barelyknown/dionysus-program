To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I have read your manifesto with the bemused interest of a man who has spent forty years staring into the microscope at yeast. It is a strange sensation to see the machinery of the vacuole applied to the machinery of human bureaucracy.

When I began my work in the late 1980s, the degradation of proteins was considered a boring subject. Every other biologist wanted to understand how the cell synthesizes new things—how it reads DNA to build proteins. That is the glamorous side of life. Synthesis is growth. Synthesis is the future. The disposal of waste was viewed as a mundane housekeeping chore, something the cell does quietly in the background.

You have correctly identified that this view is fatal.

In the cell, there is no such thing as static stability. There is only dynamic equilibrium. Our bodies synthesize hundreds of grams of protein every day, but we do not gain hundreds of grams of weight. Why? Because we are degrading protein at the exact same rate. We are in a constant state of self-cannibalization. This is not a failure of the system; it is the definition of being alive. Without this turnover, we would clog with errors and die.

However, I must offer a correction to your metaphor from a cellular perspective. You speak of "breaking things." This is imprecise. In the cell, the most critical step of autophagy is not the digestion itself, but the sequestration.

Before the cell eats a part of itself, it wraps that part in a double membrane called the autophagosome. This is the most beautiful structure I have ever seen. It creates a distinct space within the cytoplasm—a temporary vessel that separates the cargo from the rest of the cell. Only once the cargo is safely enclosed does the autophagosome fuse with the vacuole (or lysosome) to unleash the enzymes that dissolve it.

If you were to unleash those lytic enzymes without the container—without the autophagosome—you would not get renewal. You would get necrosis. The cell would digest its own essential machinery indiscriminately and perish.

This seems to be what you call "Ritual Time." You are attempting to construct a social autophagosome. You are trying to build a membrane of rules and covenants that isolates the criticism from the people, just as the membrane isolates the cargo from the cytosol. You are right to do this. If you try to metabolize error without the membrane—without the containment of the ritual—you will simply dissolve the organism.

In my lab, we induce autophagy by starvation. When the cell lacks nutrients, it ruthlessly breaks down its own components to release the amino acids required to survive. It is a survival strategy. It turns the past into the fuel for the present.

Your "Dionysus Program" suggests that organizations are currently starving for truth, and that they must learn to eat their own illusions to survive. It is a sound biological hypothesis. Life does not persist by preserving itself in amber. Life persists by breaking itself down and building itself up, over and over again, until the chemistry stops.

Do not neglect the membrane. Without it, you are only destroying.
