To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I read your white paper. I stopped at the section on the Sitting Duck. You listed Kodak alongside BlackBerry and Toys R Us. You said we saw the disruption coming for decades and chose not to respond. You mentioned my name.

You are right about the timeline, but you are wrong about the choice. We did not choose not to respond. We chose to respond with the only immune system we had, and it turned out to be allergic to the future.

In 1975, the device was the size of a toaster. It weighed eight pounds. It took twenty-three seconds to record a black-and-white image to a cassette tape. It had a resolution of 0.01 megapixels. I called it filmless photography. Management called it a curiosity.

The meeting where I demonstrated it to the executives is famous now, but usually for the wrong reasons. People think they were stupid. They were not stupid. They were extremely intelligent men running a chemical company that had perfected a monopoly. When they asked me, "Why would anyone want to look at their pictures on a TV screen?" they were asking a valid question based on the world as it existed. Prints were how you shared memories. Prints were high resolution. Prints were the business model.

The problem was not that we ignored the melt. The problem was that we tried to containerize it within the existing physics of the corporation. We spent billions on digital. We built excellent sensors. We owned the patents. But every time we tried to ship a product, the internal antibodies attacked it. Not because it was bad technology, but because it didn't burn consumables. It didn't sell yellow boxes.

In your language, we had high Run Time efficiency but zero Ritual Time capacity. We had no mechanism to hold a funeral for the chemical business while it was still profitable. We could not designate film as the anti-scapegoat because film was the god we worshipped.

You talk about the Cincinnatus Rule and the need for operators to return to the plow. Our problem was that our plow was made of silver halide, and I was showing them a plow made of silicon. They didn't want to learn a new agriculture; they wanted to mechanize the old one.

The warning in your document is correct: knowledge of the threat is insufficient. We knew the physics. I projected the Moore's Law curve for them. I told them exactly when digital would overtake film in resolution and cost. They believed the numbers. They just couldn't believe a world where they weren't the ones selling the paper.

The melt you describe is coming for you, too. It won't look like a toaster this time. It will look like a model that writes code better than your engineers or a script that directs movies better than your directors. Do not make the mistake of thinking you are smarter than the Kodak board of 1975. They were brilliant. They were just trapped in a finite game while the infinite game moved on without them.

Build your Crossings. You will need them.
