You have given the melt a name and built elaborate machinery to contain it. But naming the fire does not make you its master.

I gave Athens laws they could bear, not the best laws imaginable. You offer forms too heavy for most assemblies to lift. Your Crossings require trust that must be earned before the Crossing can teach anyone to earn it. This is the old problem: the physician who can only treat the healthy.

You warn against the Village Honest Person who follows procedure without soul. Then you provide procedures. You warn against priesthood. Then you create stewards, rotation schedules, sortition pools, Jesters with protected speech, tribunals with oath-helpers. Each safeguard requires its own safeguard. The machine grows. Someone must tend it. They become what you warned against.

I left Athens after making my reforms. Not from virtue. From knowledge that if I stayed, the laws would become about me rather than about themselves. Your Cincinnatus Rule names this danger. But you remain, writing the manual, explaining the explanations, adding appendices to the appendices. Who will leave your program so it can stand alone?

You say nothing is sacred except the commitment to metabolize error without sacrifice. But you have made metabolism sacred. You have made the loop sacred. You perform elaborate rites to avoid scapegoating, and the scapegoat has become any belief that refuses to melt on schedule. Some things should be stable. Some losses should remain losses. A city that treats all grief as fuel will forget what it was grieving for.

The old tragedies did not teach us to metabolize. They taught us to witness what cannot be undone.

Your equation measures explanatory reach, but reach is not wisdom. Your archetypes name the ways organizations fail, but naming the cliff does not teach a man to stop walking toward it. You have written a manual for people who already possess what the manual cannot give them.

I do not say your machinery is useless. Some of it is good. The rest is elaborate. But elaborate is not the same as true, and naming the disease does not cure it.

Not Solon
