To the Editor of the Dionysus Program:

I have read your manifesto with the blend of interest and alarm customary to a man who sees his own instruments taken up by a stranger and used to build a temple. You have cited me, and you have cited my student David Deutsch, and for the most part, you have understood the central epistemological claim: that knowledge grows only through the ruthless elimination of error.

However, I must write to correct a dangerous tilt in your architecture.

You are right that we advance by killing our theories so that we do not have to kill each other. This is the very foundation of the Open Society. When you speak of the "Anti-Scapegoat," you are operationalizing the concept of non-violent refutation. You are building a mechanism where the hypothesis can die in the place of the believer. For this, I applaud you. It is a triumph of critical rationalism to institutionalize the separation of the man from his ideas.

But you seem to have forgotten why I feared the "Dionysian" in the first place. You invoke Nietzsche's categories as if the surrender to the collective pulse is a benign utility. It is not. The "melting of meanings" and the "collective effervescence" you praise are the hallmarks of the Closed Society—the tribal, magical, irrational past from which civilization has painfully emerged.

My concern is your concept of the "Great Dissolution." It smacks of Utopian social engineering. You suggest that we must periodically melt down the structures of value and identity to renew them. This is historicist folly. We cannot restart civilization from zero, nor can we redesign a society (or a company) as a whole. We can only engage in piecemeal social engineering—fixing this specific error, adjusting that specific lever, alleviating this specific suffering.

When you invite a group to "melt" together, you invite the return of the tribe. You risk creating a space where the critical faculty is submerged in emotion. You say that Apollo needs Dionysus to handle the pain of change. I say that Apollo needs only the courage to admit he was wrong. We do not need festivals of misrule; we need the modesty to accept that our current solutions are merely provisional conjectures waiting to be falsified.

Yet, I admit a grudging admiration for your "Cincinnatus Rule." You have correctly identified that the enemies of the open society are often those who claim to protect it—the guardians who become a priesthood. By forcing authority to return to the plow, you prevent the ossification of the ruling caste. This is good democratic hygiene.

Your program is a paradox. You use the tools of irrationalism (ritual, myth, tragedy) to protect the engine of rationalism (error correction). It is a dangerous gamble. If your rituals serve to make criticism cheaper and safer, they are allies of freedom. If they serve to make the group feel good about itself while suppressing the lone dissenter who refuses to chant the liturgy, they are enemies of the truth.

Proceed with caution. The Open Society is not a dance; it is an argument. Do not let the music drown out the objection.
