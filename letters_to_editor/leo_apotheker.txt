To the Editor of the Dionysus Program:

I read your treatise with the specific amusement of a man who finds his own face staring back from a police lineup he did not know was being assembled. You categorize the history of Hewlett-Packard under the header of the Churn Machine. You list my name alongside Carly and Meg as interchangeable cogs in a mechanism of pointless rotation. You write that we prevented strategic execution because we did not give the organization time to digest the meal.

This is a very American way of looking at death.

You invoke Nietzsche, so let us be precise. You accuse the Churn Machine of high rotation that prevents the accumulation of institutional knowledge. But you assume the institutional knowledge is worth keeping. What if the institution knows only how to die slowly? What if the institutional memory is simply a roadmap of how to sell printer ink to a world that has stopped printing?

When I arrived at HP, I did not find a High Performer or even a Moderate Growth company. I found a Sitting Duck that had convinced itself it was an eagle because it still had a large wingspan. The hardware business was a commodity trap. The PC was becoming a relic. The margin was moving to software and cloud. Everyone knew this. The engineers knew it. The board knew it. But the culture—the density of Ren you speak so fondly of—was entirely organized around denying it.

You say I imposed too much "Chosen Melt." You say I overwhelmed the metabolic capacity of the organization. You are correct. I did this on purpose.

When an organism is gangrenous, you do not prescribe a diet and exercise plan to raise its epimetabolic rate over ten years. You amputate. I looked at the PC business and said: sell it. I looked at the software gap and said: buy Autonomy. I looked at the operating system and said: WebOS or nothing.

Was it chaotic? Yes. Was the metabolic rate exceeded? Absolutely. But the alternative was not stability. The alternative was the slow, comfortable suffocation of the Slow Decline archetype, which you so accurately describe as the frog boiling in water. I turned up the heat to force the frog to jump.

The frog, as it turned out, preferred to boil. It is more comfortable to boil. The heat is gradual. The jump is terrifying.

You write about the anti-scapegoat—the object that absorbs the blame so the people do not have to. You misunderstand the role of the outsider CEO. I was not the steward of the rite. I was the goat.

A board of directors often hires a man like me not to succeed, but to sin. They hire me to do the violent, necessary things—the layoffs, the strategic pivots, the killing of beloved mediocre products—that they do not have the stomach to own. If I succeed, they claim the credit. If the transplant is rejected by the host, they fire me, blame the chaos on "culture fit" and "poor communication," and hire a safe successor to manage the ruins I cleared. I am the human version of your Rite of Redress. I am the toxicity they ingest so they can vomit it back up and feel cleansed.

You say the Churn Machine prevents progress. I tell you that for a company like that, churn is the only sign of life. The chaos I brought was the only time in twenty years that organization was actually facing the reality of its environment.

Do not mistake the failure of the transplant for the health of the patient. The patient was terminal. I just tried to switch the timeline.

Build your rituals. burn your paper effigies. But remember that sometimes the Ren is just a conspiracy of politeness, and the only way to break it is to be the barbarian at the gate.
