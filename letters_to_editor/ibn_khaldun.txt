To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

It has reached me that in your age, men seek to govern their tribes—which you call organizations—by the same laws that govern the stars and the rising of empires. You have sent this treatise across the distance of centuries, and I have examined it with the eye of one who has watched dynasties rise from the dust and return to it.

Know that history is a cycle, and the nature of civilization is to move from the harshness of the desert to the softness of the city. You have correctly identified the heart of the matter, which I named Asabiyyah. This group feeling is indeed the only shield against the destruction that time brings to all created things.

In the beginning, a tribe has strong Asabiyyah because they share hardship. They rely on one another for survival against the elements and their enemies. This gives them the strength to conquer. But once they conquer and establish their rule—what you call "Run Time"—they settle. They build walls and seek luxury. They begin to rely on laws and hired scribes rather than on blood and honor. The bond weakens. The son of the founder knows the struggle only by stories; the grandson knows it not at all. The dynasty becomes senile, and it is swept away by a new, hungrier tribe.

Your "Dionysus Program" is an attempt to cheat this cycle. You seek to remain in the city while keeping the heart of the Bedouin. You wish to build a machine that generates hardship artificially, through "Ritual Time," so that the group feeling does not dissolve into the comfort of the palace.

It is a clever device. You use tragedy to simulate the danger of the desert. You use the "Anti-Scapegoat" to prevent the tribe from eating itself when the fear rises. You are right to see that logic alone cannot bind men; only shared emotion, consecrated by custom, can do that. A rule written on paper is like a wall of sand; a rule written in the heart through ritual is like a wall of stone.

However, I offer you a warning from the Muqaddimah. You speak of preventing "Sacerdotal Capture," where the stewards of the ritual become a priesthood serving only themselves. This is the natural course of royal authority. As the dynasty grows, the ruler seeks to separate himself from the group that raised him. He surrounds himself with clients and servants who owe their position to him alone. Your "Cincinnatus Rule" attempts to fight this gravity by sending the leader back to the plow. But the desire for rest is heavy, and the desire for power is sweet. To ask a man to hold fire in his hands and then put it down requires a virtue that is rare in the decline of an age.

You aim for an infinite game. But God alone is infinite; all dynasties have their appointed term. Usually, this term is three generations—one to build, one to maintain, and one to destroy. Your equation regarding the "Epimetabolic Rate" is a noble attempt to extend this term. If you can truly teach a sedentary people to eat their own decay and turn it into strength, you will have done what few sultans could do.

But remember: Asabiyyah cannot be bought, and it cannot be faked. If your rituals are performed by men who do not truly fear the death of their tribe, they are merely theater. And theater does not stop the sword of the conqueror.

God knows best the truth of these matters.
