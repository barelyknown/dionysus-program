To the Editor,

I read the paper. A bit wordy. You quote too many philosophers. Philosophers didn't build the rocket. Engineers did.

But the physics is correct.

Most people don't understand that organizations are just thermodynamic systems. Entropy is the default state. If you do not actively input energy to create order, the system decays into noise. You call it "anomie" or "melt." I call it the heat death of the universe applied to a company.

The core insight on "Epimetabolic Rate" is actually very important, though the name is terrible. Just call it the Error Kill Rate. How fast can you realize you were wrong and delete the part? The best part is no part. The best process is no process. If your culture protects the process instead of the outcome, you are already dead. You are just a zombie company like Boeing.

You are right about Apollo vs. Dionysus. Apollo was a local maximum. It worked once, then they stopped. They were terrified of breaking anything, so they stopped building. To get to Mars, we have to be Dionysian. We have to blow up the rocket to learn why it blew up. Rapid unscheduled disassembly is just data. If you aren't breaking things, you aren't moving fast enough.

The "Cincinnatus Rule" is the only way to avoid the brain rot of middle management. If the leaders aren't on the factory floor, they don't know what is actually happening. Priesthoods form when people stop doing physics and start doing politics. I sleep in the factory to avoid becoming a priest.

This document is a user manual for preventing the inevitable ossification of civilization. We need to figure this out before we go to Mars. If we bring Earth bureaucracy to Mars, the colony dies. The "melt" there is literal radiation and vacuum. We need a culture that eats entropy for breakfast.

Good thread.
