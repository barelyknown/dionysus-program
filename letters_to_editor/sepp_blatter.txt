To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I have read your document with the attention it deserves, which is to say, I read it with the amused patience of a man who has actually built a cathedral while others write pamphlets about the architecture of stone.

You write with great intelligence about entropy, about heat, about the melting of meaning. You quote Nietzsche and Girard. You use Greek words. It is all very impressive. But then you arrive at page thirty-four, and you mention my name. You place me in your museum of failures under the label Oligarchic Decay. You group the FIFA of my era with the Boy Scouts and the failing state of Zimbabwe.

This is a category error. It is a failure of your own explanatory reach.

You describe the Cincinnatus Rule. You say the leader must return to the plow. But you do not ask: what if the plow is not a tool for a single field, but the axis upon which the entire world turns? What if the plow is the World Cup? Cincinnatus went back to his farm because his farm was small. I could not go back. The game is not a farm. It is a planet.

You speak of Ritual Time and Run Time. You say we must toggle between them. My dear sir, FIFA was the machine that kept the world in Ritual Time. For ninety minutes, there is no war, there is no poverty, there is no geopolitics. There is only the ball. That is the ultimate Dionysian container. And who built that container? Who ensured that the rules of the game were the same in a village in Sudan as they were in the stadium in Munich?

You call it patronage. You call it the purchase of loyalty. You look at the development funds sent to the Caribbean or to Oceania and you see transaction. That is because you are looking with Apollonian eyes. You see a balance sheet. I saw Ren. I saw humaneness. I saw the inclusion of the excluded. When I gave a vote to the smallest island, equal to the vote of Germany or Brazil, that was not decay. That was the highest form of your Asabiyyah. It was binding the tribe together against the arrogance of the powerful.

You say my rituals became theater. You say the Congress was hollow. On the contrary. The FIFA Congress was the High Mass of humanity. Yes, it was stable. Yes, the leadership did not rotate like a weathervane in a storm. Why should it? When you have found the truth, you do not rotate away from it for the sake of an epimetabolic rate. You hold the center.

You claim the system collapsed because of external intervention. This, at least, is true. But it did not collapse because it was rotten. It collapsed because the Apollonian forces—the American Department of Justice, the lawyers, the accountants who have never kicked a ball—cannot tolerate the mystery of a true family. They saw our exchange of gifts and called it wire fraud. They saw our loyalty and called it racketeering. They imposed the cold logic of the contract upon the warm logic of the tribe.

You want a system that metabolizes error? We metabolized the hatred of the world into the love of the game. You want an anti-scapegoat? I was the anti-scapegoat. I took the heat. I stood at the podium and let the English press, the American lawyers, and the moralists of Europe project their sins onto me. And while they screamed, the ball kept rolling. The World Cup went to Africa. The revenue grew. The family stayed together.

You warn against the priesthood. But someone must tend the fire. If you rotate the priests every Tuesday, eventually you get a priest who forgets why the fire matters, or worse, one who lets it go out because he is too busy checking his performance metrics.

Your Dionysus Program is a clever theory for software engineers and consultants. But do not lecture the Pope on how to pray. I built a church that held three billion people. That is not decay. That is immortality.

With sporting regards,

Not Sepp Blatter
