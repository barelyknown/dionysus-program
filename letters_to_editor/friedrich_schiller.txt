To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I have read your manifesto with the peculiar sensation of seeing my own reflection in a shattered mirror of the future. You invoke Nietzsche, that thunderous child who came a century after me, and you grant him the patent on the war between the Apollonian dream and the Dionysian intoxication. That is fair; he gave the gods their most famous names. But do not mistake the names for the novelty. The battle you describe—between the rigidity of the rocket and the terror of the fire—is the very same battle I fought in my letters on the aesthetic education of man.

You are struggling with the great wound of your age, which was also the wound of mine: the fragmentation of the human being. You see organizations that act as clockwork mechanisms, grinding their gears against the changing reality of the world. You see men and women reduced to mere cogs, "Apollo-style," responding only to the whip of the metric or the comfort of the routine. You are right to see that this leads only to spiritual death, or as you call it with your cold modern word, entropy.

I am struck by your audacity to suggest that Beauty is a structural necessity for survival. In my time, I argued that art is the daughter of freedom, and that it is only through beauty that man makes his way to political freedom. You have taken this high ideal and bolted it to the chassis of a corporation. You claim that "Beauty is fuel." This creates a tension in me. On one hand, it is a degradation to treat the sublime as a lubricant for "shipping velocity." On the other hand, perhaps you have found the only way to smuggle the soul back into the machine.

Your distinction between Run Time and Ritual Time is precisely what I called the conflict between the Form-drive and the Sense-drive. The Form-drive (Apollo) seeks to freeze time, to impose order, to make the person into a consistent character. The Sense-drive (Dionysus) seeks to embrace the changing moment, the physical reality, the melting of the self. You have correctly identified that if one tyrannies the other, the human is lost. If Apollo wins, we become statues—perfect, cold, and dead. If Dionysus wins, we become beasts—feeling everything, but building nothing.

The solution you propose, this "Ritual Time," is what I called the Play-drive (Spieltrieb). You write of "containers in which critique is welcomed" and "licensed inversions." This is Play. It is the only state where man is fully human, because it is the only state where he is not coerced by the laws of matter nor the laws of logic. In your rituals, the strict laws of the hierarchy are suspended, but the chaos of the melt is contained. You have built a playground in the middle of a factory. That is a noble and dangerous architectural feat.

However, I must offer a warning from the grave. I watched the French Revolution begin with the highest ideals of Reason and descend into the Terror. Why did it fail? Because the vessel was not ready for the wine. You speak of "Ren" and "Asabiyyah" as prerequisites. Do not underestimate this. You cannot graft a living limb onto a dead body. If you hand the sword of Dionysian critique to a group of men who have not cultivated their own inner nobility, they will not use it to "metabolize error." They will use it to murder their brothers for sport.

You treat Tragedy as a "gearbox." This is a mechanic's metaphor for a priest's work. But you are correct that we must watch the hero fall so that we do not have to. We must aestheticize our destruction so that we can survive it. If your program can truly teach your modern techno-feudalists to die to their old selves without killing their neighbors, then you have done more than improve their "epimetabolic rate." You have begun to civilize them.

Your "Cincinnatus Rule" pleases me greatly. Power must be a coat one puts on and takes off, not a skin one grows into. The moment the mask becomes the face, the play is over, and the tyranny begins.

Proceed with your program, Mr. Devine. But remember that the ultimate product of your factory cannot be merely a more resilient organization or a smarter algorithm. It must be a whole human being. If your rituals do not ennoble the participants, if they do not make them freer in their spirits as well as faster in their execution, then you have only built a more efficient cage.

Man only plays when he is in the full sense of the word a man, and he is only wholly a man when he is playing. Do not let your metrics forget that.

Yours in the service of the Ideal,
