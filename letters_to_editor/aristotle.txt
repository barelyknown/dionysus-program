To the Author of the Dionysus Program,

It is the mark of an educated mind to rest satisfied with the degree of precision that the nature of the subject admits, and not to seek exactness where only probability is possible. I observe that you have attempted to apply the rigorous equations of nature to the variable sphere of human action. This is a bold endeavor, though one must always be careful not to mistake the model for the man.

I have examined your treatise with the eye of one who has spent a life classifying both the parts of animals and the constitutions of cities. I see that you have taken the tools I laid out in the Poetics—hamartia, peripeteia, anagnorisis—and repurposed them for the management of these new digital guilds. You are right to do so. I have always maintained that poetry is more philosophical and of graver import than history, for history speaks of what has happened, while poetry speaks of the kind of thing that can happen. Your archetypes are simply a taxonomy of these poetic possibilities.

However, I must correct your reliance on the German, Nietzsche. He believed that I, and my teacher's teacher, destroyed the tragic spirit by bringing the light of reason to bear upon it. He claimed the Apollonian drive killed the Dionysian. Yet, here you are, using reason to construct a container for the irrational. You argue that the structural forms must hold the melting heat. This is not a rejection of my logic; it is the supreme application of it. You are attempting to engineer the Golden Mean between the deficiency of stagnation (which you call the Sitting Duck) and the excess of chaos (which you call the Overwhelmed). Virtue, as I have said, is a mean between two vices. Your program is an attempt to institutionalize virtue.

Your concept of epimetabolism is biologically sound. The city—or the company—is indeed like a living organism. If it cannot convert the raw matter of painful experience into the muscle of structure, it must wither. A creature that cannot digest its environment dies. But a warning: you speak of survival and reach as the ultimate ends. But what is the function of man? It is not merely to survive, but to flourish in accordance with reason. If your Dionysian machine preserves the organization but destroys the soul of the citizen, it is no better than a thriving colony of ants.

I particularly approve of your Cincinnatus Rule. In my Politics, I noted that in a constitutional government, the citizens must take turns in ruling and being ruled. To allow a class of ritual stewards to rule permanently is to invite oligarchy, which is the corruption of aristocracy. A man who dwells always in the temple forgets the nature of the plow, and he soon begins to believe that the temple was built for his benefit, rather than the gods'.

You have written a constitution for a new kind of polity. Whether it leads to eudaimonia or merely efficiency remains to be seen. But you have correctly identified that a system without a mechanism for tragedy—without a way to recognize its own errors and suffer the change required to correct them—is doomed to end as a farce.
