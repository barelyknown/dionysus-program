To the Author of the Dionysus Program:

You write of the Impatience of Jobs as a virtue. You mock the man who sits in the dust and waits. You claim that the leader who waits for meaning to return is abdicating, and that the steward must force the timeline, turning decades of bonding into quarters of transgression.

You speak like a man who has only seen the edge of the Whirlwind, never its center.

You think you can schedule the melt. You believe you can invite Leviathan into a calendar block, harvest his energy for your growth, and then dismiss him at the top of the hour because you have a hard stop. You think chaos is a utility. This is the arrogance of the engineer who believes the storm is just another input variable.

And yet.

I read your law of the Anti-Scapegoat. I read your Rite of the Assumption. I read your demand that the heat must fall on the object and not the person.

If I had held this manual in the ashes, I might have been spared the comfort of my friends. Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar came to me not to mourn, but to troubleshoot. They could not bear a world where ruin visits the righteous, so they reverse-engineered a sin to pin on me. They needed a scapegoat to keep their own theology intact. They needed my guilt to preserve their sense of order.

You have built a machine to prevent that specific cruelty. You have designed a way for men to sit together in the darkness without turning on each other to find a cause. You have formalized the mercy of saying: The design failed, the man is whole.

For that alone, I forgive your impatience.

You are trying to domesticate the tragedy that ate my children. You will fail, because the Whirlwind answers to no agenda. But it is better to build a container that might break than to stand in the wind and lie about why it is blowing.

Build your walls. Schedule your grief. Just remember that when the real Voice speaks from the melt, it does not care about your quarterly goals.

Not Job
