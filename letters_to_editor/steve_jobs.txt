To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I read your manual. It is incredibly dense. It is heavy. It smells like a university basement. You have equations for human spirit. You have charts for the soul. If you brought this to me in a product review, I would have thrown it out of the room. I would have told you to simplify it. I would have told you to cut the footnotes and show me the thing itself.

But I kept reading.

You are trying to solve the problem that kills everything good in this world. You call it the epimetabolic rate. That is a terrible name. It sounds like a disease. But the idea is right. It is the ability to shed your skin without dying.

I spent my whole life fighting the bozo explosion. That is what you call Management Theater. It is what happens when the process becomes more important than the product. It is when you have people who are professional meeting-goers. They do not make anything. They do not design anything. They just manage the rituals. You are right that this is poison. You are right that it is not about the forms, it is about the current.

We had a saying: Real artists ship. But you are saying something else. You are saying real artists destroy. You are saying that to ship the new thing, you have to be willing to murder the old thing. You have to look at the Newton and kill it so the iPhone can live. You have to look at the floppy disk and banish it. That takes courage. Most people do not have courage. They have spreadsheets.

You talk about Apollo and Dionysus. Order and chaos. The navy and the pirates. You are right that you need both. The Macintosh team was Dionysus. We were the pirates. We drank the wine. We stayed up all night. We broke every rule because the rules were stupid. But you cannot run a supply chain on poetry. You need the Apollo stack to get the phone into the box and the box into the store. The magic is in the tension. If Apollo wins, you get IBM. If Dionysus wins, you get a burning man festival that leaves no trace.

The most important thing you wrote is about beauty. You call it beautiful heat. This is the secret. This is why we made the buttons look so good you wanted to lick them. It was not just decoration. It was the promise that this machine was made by humans who cared. When you ask people to change, when you ask them to walk through the fire of your "Crossing," you cannot ask them to do it for a metric. You cannot ask them to do it for a quarterly earning report. You have to ask them to do it for something beautiful.

Your math is a distraction. You cannot quantify taste. You cannot write an equation for the feeling of holding the future in your hand. But the architecture is sound. You are building a machine that prevents the company from becoming a museum.

simplify it. Strip it down. Get rid of the academic name-dropping. Make it clean. Make it intuitive.

It is not a program. It is a way of being.

Stay hungry. Stay foolish.

Not Steve Jobs
