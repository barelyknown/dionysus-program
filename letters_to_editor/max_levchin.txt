Sean,

I read the draft. You have successfully engineered a social operating system for high-functioning paranoia.

The physics of it are correct. In the early days at PayPal, we did not have these names for it. We did not call it "Dionysian" or "Ritual Time." We just called it "being right." But the mechanic was identical. We had extreme external melt—fraudsters trying to kill us, Visa trying to kill us, eBay trying to buy us and kill us. If we had tried to smooth that curve, we would have died. The only way out was to eat the entropy faster than it could eat us.

Your concept of the anti-scapegoat is the critical variable. Most organizations optimize for consensus because consensus feels safe. It lowers the immediate temperature. But consensus is lossy. It smooths away the edges where the actual information lives. We optimized for conflict because conflict is high-bandwidth. We attacked the code, the design, and the assumption. If you cannot separate the person from the artifact, you cannot have high-bandwidth conflict. You just have politics.

Here is the vulnerability in your source code: The Readiness Gate.

You are optimistic about the ability of average organizations to run this kernel. High-intensity ritual requires high-density talent. If you install the Dionysus Program in a company filled with B-players, they will not use the anti-scapegoat to metabolize error. They will use it to ritualize excuses. They will use the "no-blame covenant" to lower their own accountability rather than to raise the system's intelligence.

The Cincinnatus Rule is your only patch for this. If you let a professional class of "culture stewards" run these rites, you are finished. It must be operators. It must be the people who wake up at 3 AM when the database locks up. If the people managing the entropy are not the same people suffering from the entropy, the feedback loop is broken.

Do not let HR touch this.

You are right about the scoreboard. Revenue is a lagging indicator. Epimetabolic rate is the leading indicator. If you can digest a wrong worldview and output a right one faster than the market, you win. If you cannot, you are just waiting for the volatility that finally kills you.

Good luck with the launch.
