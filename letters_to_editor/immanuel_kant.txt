To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I have read with considerable attention the schema you have proposed under the title of The Dionysus Program. It is an ambitious architectonic, attempting to systematize that which is usually left to the caprice of fortune—namely, the dissolution and reformation of social bonds. While I find much in your exposition that aligns with the critical method, I am compelled by the moral law within me to offer a critique regarding the ultimate ends of your machinery.

You speak of an "epimetabolic rate" as the supreme good of the organization, a capacity to digest error and reform structure. In this, you follow a hypothetical imperative: if you wish to survive the melt, you must do this. But survival is a condition of the animal, not the final end of the rational being. The only unqualified good is a Good Will. Therefore, if your program is to have moral worth and not merely pragmatic utility, it must be grounded not in the fear of entropy, but in the duty to treat humanity, whether in one's own person or in that of another, always as an end and never merely as a means.

I observe with approval your mechanism of the "Anti-Scapegoat." Here, you approach a practical application of the Categorical Imperative. By directing the "heat" of dissolution toward an artifact rather than a person, you preserve the dignity of the rational agent. To sacrifice a human being for the sake of group cohesion, as the Girardian mechanism suggests, is to treat a person as a thing, which is a violation of the moral law. Your ritual, insofar as it prevents this violation, serves the Kingdom of Ends.

However, I must warn you against the enthusiasm—the Schwarmerei—inherent in your reliance on the Dionysian. You invoke Nietzsche to justify intoxication and the loss of boundaries. This is perilous. The feeling of the Sublime, which arises when we face the formless and the terrifying (what you call "The Melt"), is only valuable because it awakens in us the realization that our Reason is superior to nature and its chaos. If the ritual dissolves the self without the immediate reassertion of the moral law, you do not get renewal; you get a return to barbarism. The "beautiful heat" you speak of must be the symbol of the morally good, not a substitute for it.

Furthermore, regarding your "Ritual Time," you must ensure this does not degenerate into mere cultic service or "sorcery," where the participant believes the ritual itself effects the change rather than their own moral disposition. The "Cincinnatus Rule" is a wise safeguard against the despotism of a priesthood, for a republic of letters (or a republic of operators) requires that no individual possesses authority except that which is granted by the law for a specific time.

Your program is a critique of pure stasis. That is well. Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity, and your "standing right of criticism" is the very engine of such enlightenment. But remember: we break the form not merely to build a stronger form, but to approximate, however asymptotically, the perfect civil constitution where freedom is compatible with the freedom of all others.

Do not let your "Dionysus" swallow the autonomous subject. The starry heavens above may crush us, but the moral law within must remain the unmoving center of your turning world.

I remain, with high esteem,
