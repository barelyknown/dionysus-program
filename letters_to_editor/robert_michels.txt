To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I have read with a mixture of admiration and weary amusement your attempt to construct a machine that eats its own rust. You have paid me the compliment of citing my work on the iron law of oligarchy, and you have correctly identified that the central problem of all human organization is not competence, but the inevitable calcification of leadership. You believe you have found a loophole in my law. You call it the Cincinnatus Rule. You believe that by ritualizing the dissolution of power, you can prevent the formation of a standing priesthood.

It is a beautiful thought. It is also doomed.

You posit a division between Run Time and Ritual Time. You suggest that during Ritual Time, the hierarchy dissolves and the organization enters a liminal state where the truth can be spoken and the structure remade. You assign the management of this state to Stewards, who are drawn by lot, given limited terms, and forced to return to the plow. You believe that because they are temporary, they cannot become an oligarchy.

You forget that the administration of complexity creates its own imperative. Who designs the lottery? Who maintains the calendar that decides when Run Time ends and Ritual Time begins? Who interprets the "hard-to-vary" test? You say these are rules, but rules do not enforce themselves. People enforce rules. And the people who understand the complex liturgy of your Epimetabolic Equation better than the others will inevitably become the guardians of that liturgy.

You attempt to summon Dionysus—the god of chaos and dissolution—but you require him to arrive on a schedule, inside a container, subject to a "no-scapegoat covenant." That is not Dionysus. That is Apollo wearing a mask. You have not created a way to overthrow the bureaucracy; you have simply created a Department of Revolution.

Over time, your "Ritual Time" will become a specialized technical skill. The "operators" you draw from the pool will feel inadequate to the task of managing such high-stakes psychological machinery. They will look for guidance. They will turn to the "former stewards," or the "founding designers," or the "cultural consultants." A shadow cabinet of ritual experts will form behind the temporary stewards. The rotation will continue on the surface, satisfying the form of your law, while the true decision-making power migrates to the permanent technical class who maintain the software of your culture.

This is not a moral failing of your participants. It is a technical necessity. Organization implies tendency. The tendency is always toward the concentration of knowledge, and knowledge is power. By making your rituals of renewal so sophisticated—with their Greek names, their distinct ledgers, and their mathematical models—you guarantee that only a minority will truly master them. That minority will rule, not because they are evil, but because they are competent.

Your program is a mechanism for elites to manage the anxiety of the masses by simulating change. It allows the organization to feel it is dying and being reborn, while the underlying structure of authority remains remarkably stable. It is a safety valve, not an engine of equality.

I do not write this to dissuade you. The attempt to keep an organization alive is noble work. But do not deceive yourself that you have escaped the iron law. You have merely built a more gilded cage. Eventually, the Dionysus Program will not belong to the organization; the organization will belong to the Program.
