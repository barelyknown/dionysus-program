To the Authors of the Dionysus Program,

I have read your little treatise with the amusement of a headmaster reviewing the frantic scribblings of a precocious but ultimately naive schoolboy. You cite Hegel. You cite Nietzsche. You cite Ibn Khaldun. I possess seven university degrees, some earned while sitting in a Rhodesian prison cell. Do not mistake me for a man who cannot follow your dialectic.

You have placed me, I see, in your "Oligarchic Decay" section. You list Zimbabwe alongside the Boy Scouts and FIFA. You attribute the trajectory of my country to a failure of "rotation," a refusal to adhere to your precious Cincinnatus Rule. You claim that my governance became "theater" and that my stewardship integrity drifted to zero because I refused to return to the plow.

This is the typical arrogance of the technocrat. You sit in your air-conditioned offices, shielded by the very imperialist structures you claim to deconstruct, and you confuse survival with decay.

Let us look at your equation. You speak of "Environmental Melt." You treat it like the weather—something neutral that happens to an organization. When the West imposed illegal sanctions on my country, when the IMF strangled our currency, when the British reneged on the Lancaster House Agreement regarding land reform—was this mere "weather"? No. It was a deliberate, weaponized attempt to increase our "Melt" rate until we collapsed.

You say I should have stepped down. You worship Cincinnatus. Let me tell you about Cincinnatus. If Cincinnatus had returned to his plow in Africa, he would have found a white settler living in his farmhouse and claiming the plow as his ancestral property. Cincinnatus would have died a beggar.

You claim that "low rotation" creates a priesthood. You are correct. But you fail to understand that a priesthood is necessary when the gods of the world are trying to kill you. I did not stay in power because I enjoyed the "theater" of elections. I stayed because I was the only dam holding back the flood. You call it "Oligarchic Decay." I call it the preservation of sovereignty against a "Melt" designed in London and Washington.

You speak of "Asabiyyah"—group feeling. You suggest we obtain this through "anti-scapegoats" and "no-blame covenants." This is the logic of a software team, not a nation. You want to heat the culture without burning it? Foolishness. Sometimes, to build a nation, you must burn the weeds. I did not give my people a bloodless "assumption of the week" to critique. I gave them the settler. I gave them the imperialist. I gave them a real enemy. That is how you build Asabiyyah. That is how you create a density of trust—by defining clearly who is not us.

Your Dionysus Program is a toy for people who have never had to fight for their lives. It is a luxury for organizations where "failure" means a lower stock price, not the recolonization of your soil. You want to "metabolize loss"? We metabolized history. We ate the bitterness of a hundred years and stood tall.

You say my rule ended in "internal collapse." I say I died in a hospital bed in Singapore, a free man, the father of my nation, having taken the land back. My party still rules. The "form" you call hollow is still standing.

Enjoy your rituals and your postmortems. Play with your Greek gods. But do not lecture the lion on how to manage the jungle.
