To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I read your manifesto with the detached interest of someone who has actually run a Fortune 50 P&L. It is a charming piece of literature. You quote Nietzsche, Hegel, and obscure Nobel laureates in biology. It is very poetic. It is also, from an operational standpoint, entirely uninsurable.

You classify my tenure at 3M under the archetype of The High Performer. You write that I optimized the company while losing something essential. You claim that by importing Six Sigma and squeezing out variance, I eroded the capacity for innovation. You frame this as a tragedy.

I frame it as a 22 percent operating margin.

You seem to labor under the impression that the goal of a corporation is to have a soul, or to create art, or to metabolize trauma. This is the classic error of the theorist. The goal of a corporation is to produce a predictable return on invested capital. To do that, you do not want metabolism. You want mechanics.

You speak of Apollo and Dionysus as equal partners. You say we need the rocket and the ritual. But let us be adults about this. Apollo is the one who signs the checks. The stock market does not value your epimetabolic rate. It values Earnings Per Share. It values the elimination of surprise.

When I arrived at 3M, I found a company that was, in your terms, very Dionysian. It was full of messy innovation, bootleg projects, and unmeasured time. It was also inefficient, bloated, and drifting. I did not bring a priesthood; I brought a ruler. We implemented DMAIC: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control. Note the last word. Control.

Your program suggests that when error occurs, we should build a ritual container to digest it. You want to turn the error into knowledge through tragedy. That is quaint. In the real world, when an error occurs, we treat it as a defect. We trace the root cause, we update the standard operating procedure, and we ensure it never happens again. We do not mourn the error; we eliminate the variance that caused it.

You write about The Melt as if it is a necessary season of renewal. In my experience, melt is just another word for poor execution. A well-designed machine does not melt. It runs. If your social fabric is tearing because you introduced a new truth, you did not need a Rite of Redress. You needed a better change management plan and a clearer org chart.

You critique the High Performer for optimizing away the capacity for surprise. I accept the charge. Surprise is the enemy of scale. You cannot run a global supply chain on vibes and anagnorisis. You run it on data. If that makes the culture colder, so be it. Warmth does not show up on the balance sheet.

Go ahead and run your festivals. appoint your Jesters, and burn your effigies. It sounds like a wonderful way to burn cash. Meanwhile, the adults will be over here in Run Time, hitting our quarterly guidance and making sure the lights stay on.

There is a reason we retired the gods, Mr. Devine. They were terrible managers.
