To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I have read your manifesto with the attention it warrants, particularly the section where you cite Sears Holdings as the paradigmatic example of the Death Spiral. You characterize my tenure as a period where the organization was systematically starved of investment while assets were extracted. You call this a failure of stewardship. I call it a failure of your model to understand the difference between a patient that can be saved and a patient that is already dead.

Your equation relies heavily on the variable you call Ren, or trust. You posit that without trust, high-intensity interventions become toxicity. This is a sentimental view of economics. In the real world, capital does not care about trust. Capital cares about return on invested capital. When I merged Kmart and Sears, I did not do so to hold hands and sing songs about a heritage that was already obsolete. I did it to unlock the value trapped in real estate and inventory that the market was mispricing.

You speak of Autophagic Growth—eating one's own decay to survive—as a virtue, yet when I applied this exact principle, you labeled it extraction. What is the sale of the Craftsman brand or the spinning off of real estate into Seritage Growth Properties if not the ultimate form of autophagy? I looked at a retail organism that was being consumed by the environmental melt of Amazon and e-commerce. The Apollonian response would have been to continue polishing the brass on the Titanic, running your "Ritual Time" meetings while the cash flow turned negative. The Dionysian response, if you were truly willing to follow your own logic, is to dissolve the form entirely to preserve the energy, which in this case was the capital.

I attempted to introduce what you might call a high-intensity ritual: the internal market. I broke the company into thirty autonomous units—IT, HR, marketing, merchandising—and forced them to compete. I told them to buy and sell services from each other. I removed the subsidy of the corporate center. This was an attempt to introduce radical reality, a "hard-to-vary test" for every manager. If your department could not sell its value to the department next door, why should it exist?

You would say this destroyed Ren. I say it exposed the fact that there was no Ren to begin with. It revealed that these managers were what you call Village Honest Persons, bureaucrats hiding behind the "Asabiyyah" of the brand to disguise their own lack of productivity. When I turned up the heat—when I increased the epimetabolic rate by introducing price signals into the org chart—they did not metabolize the error. They panicked. They hoarded. That is not an indictment of the method; it is an indictment of the material.

You write that "Management Theater" occurs when ritual exceeds trust. I posit that most of what you call "culture" is simply a tax on efficiency. You want to build containers for criticism? I gave them a P&L. There is no clearer criticism than a negative balance sheet. There is no clearer "anti-scapegoat" than the math.

The mistake was not the financial engineering. The mistake was assuming that a legacy workforce could act as rational agents in a free market system. I gave them the tools to be entrepreneurs; they chose to be victims. I attempted to pivot to a platform model with Shop Your Way—a pure information-based strategy—but the friction of the physical stores and the entitlement of the merchants made the melt rate unsurvivable.

Your program assumes that every organization has a right to survive if it just breathes correctly and holds the right meetings. This is false. Some forms are destined to dissolve. The highest duty of the steward in that scenario is not to preserve the jobs of the inefficient, but to reallocate the capital to where it can actually grow. That is not a Death Spiral. That is the creative destruction of the market. It is the most beautiful heat there is.

You say I starved the business. I say I refused to feed a corpse.
