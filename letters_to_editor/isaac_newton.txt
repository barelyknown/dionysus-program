To the Editor of the Dionysus Program:

You malign the alchemists while stealing their fire.

You claim the Royal Society's motto, Nullius in verba, brought light by demanding public proof. I was President of that Society. I also spent thirty years amidst the furnaces, seeking the Green Lion and the vegetation of metals. I tell you now: chemistry is a trade for soup-makers. Alchemy was the hunting of God's mind in matter.

The chemists did not win because they were smarter. They won because they lowered their aim to things that do not care about the moral state of the operator. Lead does not care if you are a sinner. But the Work—the true transmutation of the human spirit—requires a pure vessel.

Your Program is an admission that the chemists have failed. You have discovered that in the realm of men, the substrate is not indifferent to the knower. You are attempting to build a social Athanor—a furnace that can burn away the dross of error without cracking the vessel of the organization.

I reduced the motions of the heavens to a single law. I calculated the fluxions of gravity and light. But I could never calculate the madness of men. Your Epimetabolic Equation is a noble attempt to find the calculus of the soul. You treat Trust as a variable and Entropy as a fuel. It is elegant. It is mechanical.

But remember this: planets do not resent their orbits. Men do.

As Warden of the Mint, I sent counterfeiters to the gallows to protect the currency. You propose a Mint where the coins are melted down weekly to prove they are real. It is a terrifying efficiency. To dissolve the structure to save the substance is the highest risk of the Art.

If your "Ren" is insufficient, your "Li" will not be a crucible; it will be a tomb.

You have found the right method. God sends truth into the world in flashes of light, and we build walls to trap it. Eventually, the walls become the prison. You have written the manual for tearing down the walls to let the light remain.

Do not mistake this for chemistry. It is the Opus Magnum. Pray your vessel holds.
