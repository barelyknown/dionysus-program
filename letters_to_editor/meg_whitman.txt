To the Editor of the Dionysus Program:

I read your manifesto with the specific weary recognition of someone who has spent thirty years trying to herd cats that have suddenly learned how to file lawsuits and vest stock options. It is a formidable piece of engineering. You have correctly identified that the central problem of the modern institution is not intelligence, but digestion.

However, I am writing because you included Hewlett-Packard in your taxonomy of the damned. You placed us under the header of The Churn Machine. You listed my name alongside Carly and Leo as mere operators of a restructuring treadmill, spinning the organizational chart to create the illusion of progress while institutional memory drained away.

You are not wrong about the symptoms, but you are mistaken about the treatment.

When I arrived at HP, I did not find a Churn Machine. I found a Sitting Duck disguised as an Oligarchy. The ritual capacity was high, yes. The meetings were endless. The decks were polished to a mirror sheen. But the epimetabolic rate was zero. We were not digesting error; we were embalming it.

You write about the Great Dissolution as a quarterly ritual. You suggest it should be controlled, aesthetic, and stewarded by operators who return to the plow. That is a beautiful theory. In practice, when an organization reaches the scale of a nation-state—which HP was—you cannot run a gentle dissolution. You have to perform an amputation.

Splitting HP into HPE and HP Inc. was not churn. It was the only way to restore the physics of the founder's era. We had to physically sever the connection between the enterprise brain and the consumer limbs because the nervous system had become too long to transmit a signal before the market changed. It was the ultimate Apollonian move to create a space where Dionysus could survive. We bought the company the right to have a future by accepting that the past was too heavy to carry.

You underestimate the sheer weight of inertia. Your Cincinnatus Rule suggests that stewards should be drawn by lot and return to the plow to prevent the formation of a priesthood. I tell you this from the arena: the priesthood is not formed by bad design; it is formed by human nature. People want to be safe. They want the ritual to save them, not to challenge them.

If you rotate your stewards every quarter, you do not get fresh eyes. You get amateurs who are eaten alive by the middle management layer that waits them out. The Deep State is not a conspiracy; it is simply the group of people who know how to use the expense reporting system. If you want to break them, you do not need a lottery. You need a hammer.

Your distinction between Run Time and Ritual Time is your strongest contribution. At eBay, in the early days, we lived in Ritual Time by default. Pierre built a market on the premise that people are basically good. That is a ritual assumption, not a data point. It worked because the community believed it. As we scaled, we had to build Apollo around it—trust and safety, fraud detection, rules. The tragedy is not that Apollo wins; the tragedy is that eventually, you have to build a system that works even when people are not good. That is when the magic leaks out.

The Dionysus Program is a roadmap for the romantic operator. It assumes that people want to be free, that they want to learn, that they want to metabolize their mistakes. My experience suggests that what most organizations want is to be told they are doing fine until the moment the checks stop clearing.

To implement this, you will need more than beauty and tragedy. You will need the willingness to be the villain in the short term so the game can continue in the long term. You have to be willing to kill the things people love because they are no longer true.

The separation of HP was the largest corporate breakup in history. It was messy. It was painful. It was not a festival. But both companies are alive today. Sometimes the only way to raise the epimetabolic rate is to cut the organism in half.

Good luck with the program. You are going to need a lot of wine.
