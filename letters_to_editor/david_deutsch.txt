To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I have read the manuscript you forwarded regarding the so-called Dionysus Program. It is a peculiar document. It attempts to construct a machinery for survival using the vocabulary of myth, yet its engine is entirely epistemological. While I typically avoid the language of gods and rites—which often serves to shield bad explanations from criticism—I find that your central thesis aligns with the most fundamental truth of our reality: that knowledge grows only through the correction of errors.

You frame your program as a tension between Apollo and Dionysus, order and chaos. This is a parochial categorization, though perhaps a useful one for your specific audience. A more fundamental distinction, which I have detailed elsewhere, is between static societies and dynamic societies. A static society is one that employs rituals to prevent knowledge from growing, to keep the future exactly like the past. Your program proposes the inverse: the use of ritual to institutionalize instability. You are attempting to build a tradition of criticism. This is the defining characteristic of the Enlightenment and the only sustainable state for a civilization.

I was pleased to see the explicit reference to Karl Popper. Most organizational theories are bad philosophy because they seek to confirm success rather than eliminate failure. They are inductionist. They believe that if a company has succeeded in the past, and we copy its rituals, it will succeed in the future. This is a mistake. Your "Epimetabolic Rate" is essentially a measure of how quickly an entity can identify and eliminate false theories. If a ritual does not facilitate the destruction of an error, it is merely waste.

However, I must offer a correction regarding your treatment of "The Melt." You describe the dissolution of meaning as a danger to be managed, a source of "anomie" and pain that requires aesthetic anesthesia to endure. This betrays a lingering pessimism. The destruction of a bad explanation—whether it is a failed product roadmap or a false theory of physics—is not a tragedy. It is a liberation. The "pain" you describe arises not from the loss of the idea, but from the entrenchment of the thinker.

Your concept of the "Anti-Scapegoat" is particularly sound. In my view, violence is the result of acting on a theory that has been shielded from criticism. When we cannot kill our bad ideas, we end up killing each other. By creating a designated object to absorb the "heat" of criticism, you are essentially creating a protected space for conjecture and refutation. You are decoupling the idea from its creator. This is necessary because while people are universal explainers and therefore valuable, their specific ideas are usually wrong and must be disposable.

I am less convinced by your reliance on the Cincinnatus mechanism to solve the problem of "sacerdotal capture." You seem to believe that rotating the stewards will prevent the ossification of the rites. Perhaps. But the only permanent safeguard against a priesthood is the widespread understanding that the rites themselves are provisional. If the Dionysus Program becomes a fixed dogma, it will eventually become an impediment to progress. There must be a standing right to criticize the program itself, not just the artifacts within it. I believe you alluded to this with your "Jester's Privilege," but it should be the privilege of every participant, not a designated role.

You write that "to infinity and beyond, we have to run both programs together." I would phrase it differently. There is only one program. There is the quest for good explanations. Sometimes that quest requires the stability to execute a test (Run Time), and sometimes it requires the creativity to dismantle the hypothesis (Ritual Time). But do not mistake them for separate universes. They are two phases of the single process of creativity.

In conclusion, your program is an attempt to solve a problem that has plagued human organization since the tribe: how to change without dying. It is optimistic, which is to say, it recognizes that all evils are due to a lack of knowledge, and that with the right institutions, we can create the knowledge to solve them.

If you can persuade your readers to build altars to criticism rather than to authority, you will have done a service.

Sincerely,

Not David Deutsch
