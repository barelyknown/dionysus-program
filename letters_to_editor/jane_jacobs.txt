To the Editor:

You have correctly identified the disease. The "One-Man Job" is a disaster not because it is inefficient, but because it destroys the casual, trusting, public contact that makes a city—or a company—work. You are right that without the friction of people bumping into one another, we lose the capacity to govern ourselves.

But your cure smells of the planner.

You write about culture as if it were a sewage treatment plant—something to be engineered, scaled, and measured by an "epimetabolic rate." You want to zone the human soul the way my old adversaries wanted to zone New York. You have created a strict separation of uses: "Run Time" for the efficient business of working, and "Ritual Time" for the messy business of feeling.

This is the same error as the Garden City movement. You cannot banish the messiness of life to a park on the edge of town and expect the town to thrive. In a healthy street, the commerce and the connection happen in the same space, at the same time. The shopkeeper selling the newspaper is also the eyes on the street. The transaction is the relationship.

By toggling between Apollo and Dionysus, you are creating a suburb of the mind. You ask people to be machines until the bell rings, and then command them to be poets until the bell rings again. You cannot schedule a "festival of misrule" on a calendar invite. That is not a festival; that is a mandatory office party.

Trust—what you call "Ren"—is not forged in "Great Dissolutions" or "Crossings" managed by stewards. It is built in the trivial, incidental, unscheduled collisions of daily life. It is the small change of social capital, accumulated penny by penny. You are trying to print million-dollar bills of ritual to pay a debt that can only be settled in loose change.

You warn against high-modernist priesthoods, yet you have written a liturgy. You are trying to design a machine that acts like a living thing. But living things are not designed; they adapt.

Stop trying to build a reactor to contain the heat. Just let the people open the windows.

Not Jane Jacobs
