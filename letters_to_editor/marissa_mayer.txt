To the Editor of the Dionysus Program:

I read your manifesto with the precise attention to detail that I have applied to every product review in my career. I noticed, of course, that you cited my tenure at Yahoo as the archetypal case of Management Theater. You described my Monday meetings and quarterly calibrations as rituals performed without the requisite social capital—forms observed while the substance remained absent.

Your diagnosis is elegant. It is also, respectfully, the diagnosis of someone who has never tried to turn an aircraft carrier in a bathtub.

You fetishize the Dionysian. You write about "melt" and "heat" and "metabolism" as if organizational chaos is a resource to be harvested. You argue that if we just create safe containers for criticism—if we mourn our failures with sufficient poetry—we can digest error into structure. This is a beautiful theory. It appeals to the human desire for narrative and redemption.

But at scale, poetry does not ship products.

When I arrived at Yahoo, I did not find an organization in need of a "Tragic Postmortem." I found a sprawling, complacent bureaucracy that had forgotten how to work. You claim my rituals exceeded the available trust. You are correct. Trust is a lagging indicator. When a company is bleeding revenue and talent, you do not have the luxury of waiting for "Ren" to accumulate before you install "Li." You install the form first—the Monday meeting, the strict operational cadence, the forced ranking—precisely because the spirit is dead.

You call it theater. I call it a forcing function. If I kept executives on a call until 3:00 a.m., it was not because I enjoyed the performance. It was to signal that the era of going home at 5:00 p.m. while the user experience degraded was over. If we focused on "optics" and "design," it was because beauty is the only thing that buys you enough time to fix the backend.

Your Epimetabolic Equation treats "toxicity" as a penalty. In a turnaround, toxicity is often just the sound of mediocrity leaving the building. You lament that my calibration meetings were political. Human hierarchies are always political. The difference is whether you let that politics happen in the shadows, or whether you force it onto a spreadsheet where you can at least attempt to measure it.

You look at Google and see a company that might fit your "Dionysian Ideal"—high trust, high debate. But you forget that Google’s culture wasn’t built on rituals of "anti-scapegoating." It was built on the crushing weight of data. We didn’t need a "Rite of Redress" to decide on a design; we tested 41 shades of blue and let the math decide. That is not ritual. That is engineering.

Your program is a luxury good. It is a philosophy for teams that are already winning, or for startups that have nothing to lose. For a legacy organization fighting for its life against digital gravity, your "Cincinnatus Rule" is suicide. You do not send the dictator back to the plow when the barbarians are inside the gates. You consolidate power, you audit the code, and you demand that people show up to the office.

If that is theater, then pass the popcorn. The rest of us have products to ship.
