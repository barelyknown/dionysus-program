To the Architect of the Dionysus Program,

I have read your scroll. You use many words—Greek words, new words, long words—to describe a thing that is simple as dirt and sharp as a blade.

You speak of this Epimetabolic Rate. You speak of entropy and dissolution. To a farmer, this is just the knowledge of seasons. A field cannot bear wheat forever without rest. Sometimes you must burn the stubble. The fire is hot and it smells of smoke, but the ash feeds the soil. If you fear the fire, you starve the harvest.

You honor me by naming your rule of power after my example. You are right to do so. But you must understand why I put down the fasces and went back to the plow. It was not because I lacked ambition. It was not because I feared to rule.

It was because the plow tells the truth.

In the Senate, men speak in circles. In the temple, priests speak in riddles. In the high offices, men begin to believe they are the source of the sun's light rather than just men standing in it. The marble floor makes the feet soft. The purple robe makes the skin thin.

But the plow does not care who you are. The ox does not flatter you. If the furrow is crooked, it is crooked, and no speech will make it straight. If the seed is dead, it will not grow, no matter how many laws you pass. The soil forces a man to be honest.

You write that your stewards must return to ordinary work to avoid becoming a priesthood. This is the most important line in your papers. A man who lives only in the ritual room forgets the weight of the stone and the heat of the day. He begins to protect the ritual instead of the people. He thinks the map is the ground.

You call for "Ritual Time" and "Run Time." I knew only War Time and Farm Time. When the Aequi besieged the army on Mount Algidus, it was War Time. I took the dictatorship. I gave the orders. We broke the siege. That was the melt. That was the violence.

Then, sixteen days later, I resigned. That was the renewal. To stay longer would have been to make myself a king. Rome has no kings.

Your program is a machine for making sure Rome has no kings—not in your companies, not in your cities, not in your mind. That is a good machine. But watch your stewards closely. The hunger to remain in the temple is strong. The fear of the mud is deep.

If they do not have dirt under their fingernails, do not trust them with the rites.
