To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I have read your manual with the specific melancholy of recognition. You have correctly diagnosed the central tragedy of our age: that the objective culture—the sheer volume of knowledge, tools, and norms we create—has outpaced the capacity of the subjective spirit to inhabit it. The things we make have become more clever than we are, and they now confront us as alien taskmasters.

Your proposed remedy is a fascinating paradox. You seek to institutionalize the destruction of institutions. You wish to turn the breaking of forms into a form itself.

This animates me because it attempts to solve the conflict between Life and Form by accelerating the cycle. Life always creates forms to express itself—a role, a rule, a company—and those forms inevitably harden and stifle the life that created them. Usually, this breaking is a violent revolution. You propose to make it a scheduled meeting.

There is a danger here you must not overlook. You are attempting to invite the god of frenzy and dissolution into a calendar invite. You are trying to domesticate the very force that refuses domestication.

My concern lies in your "Ritual Time." You treat sociability and connection as mechanisms to "metabolize error." This is the ultimate triumph of the calculating intellect. But true connection—what I call sociability—succeeds only when it has no purpose outside of itself. When people meet only to fix the machine, they are merely parts of the machine. If your rituals are purely functional, they will remain cold. A gift given to purchase candor is not a gift; it is a transaction.

You are trying to engineer a soul for the machine so that the machine does not destroy its operators. It is a noble, perhaps impossible, architecture. You hope that by calculating the rate of "melt," you can keep the human spirit liquid. But remember that the hallmark of the stranger is that he is near and far at the same time. Your program asks leaders to be strangers to their own authority—to hold it and cast it aside. That requires a spiritual distance that is rare.

You attempt to construct a canal for a flood. Do not be surprised if the water simply ignores your banks.
