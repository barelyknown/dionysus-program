To the Editor of the Dionysus Program

I read your document. I printed it on the back of old liquidation filings because paper costs money and I do not waste it.

You use too many words. Epimetabolic. Dissipative structures. Nietzsche. Who pays for this ink? You could have said it in one sentence: do not spend money you do not have, and if you fail, do not cry about it, just fix the balance sheet.

You mention Marvel in your appendix. You call us The Gambler. You say we bet the company on Iron Man. You write about it like it was a romance. It was not a romance. It was collateral. We put up the rights to Captain America and the Avengers because nobody else would give us the cash. If the movie failed, we lost the characters. That is not poetry. That is looking down the barrel of a gun. It clarifies the mind better than your "beauty."

You talk about "Beautiful Heat." I will tell you what is beautiful. Solvency is beautiful. A margin is beautiful. Reusing a paper clip from the trash can is beautiful because it means you respect the value of the asset. You want "Rituals." I had a ritual. It was called turning off the lights when you leave the room.

You say in your "High Performer" section that efficiency can kill innovation. This is the talk of people who have never met a payroll during a bankruptcy. I saved Marvel because I cut the fruit baskets and the limos. I fought with the creative geniuses because they wanted to spend fifty million on a scene that adds zero to the toy sales. Now look at them. Spending three hundred million on movies that lose money. Is that your "Dionysian Ideal"? It looks like burning cash to me.

I agree with one thing. The Scavenger part. Eating your own decay. I understand this. You take the old assets, the things nobody wants, and you squeeze value out of them. That is business.

But you can keep your "Ritual Time." It sounds like paying employees to sit around and talk about their feelings instead of working. If you want to increase your "epimetabolic rate," stop buying fancy coffee and fire the people who use big words to hide that they are losing money.
