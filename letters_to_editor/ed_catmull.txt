To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I read your manifesto with a mixture of recognition and trepidation. You have managed to name, with elaborate precision, the invisible forces that keep creative organizations from stagnating. You have also, I fear, built a machine that might crush the very thing you are trying to protect.

You cite Pixar's Braintrust as an example of your "Dionysian Ideal." It is flattering to be placed in the thriving quadrant of your simulation, but I feel compelled to offer a correction from the inside of the room. You describe the Braintrust as a "ritual container" for "metabolizing melt." To us, it never felt like a ritual. It felt like a group of people trying desperately not to delude themselves.

The danger in your document—and it is a danger I wrestled with every day at Pixar and Disney—is the belief that if you just install the right mechanisms, you will get the right culture. You have written a very seductive manual. You offer "Crossings" and "Tragic Postmortems" and "Epimetabolic Equations." These are powerful tools, but tools are neutral. In the hands of a manager who lacks deep empathy, your "Rite of Redress" will not be a mechanism for healing; it will be a high-efficiency delivery system for shame.

We often said that our job was to protect the "ugly baby"—the new, fragile idea that is awkward and incomplete. My worry is that your Dionysus Program is so heavy, so full of heat and "tragic metabolism," that it might accidentally incinerate the ugly baby in the name of purifying it. You talk about "eating decay," but sometimes decay is just a necessary pause before the next growth. Efficiency is not the only goal. Sometimes, the "melt" just needs to sit there for a while without being processed into a lesson.

However, you are right about the central problem: the drift toward rigidity. I watched companies I admired—Silicon Graphics, many others—fall into the "Sitting Duck" or "Slow Decline" archetypes you describe, not because they were stupid, but because they optimized for a world that had ceased to exist. They protected the structure rather than the soul. Your insistence that we must break things to mend them is correct. Your distinction between "Run Time" and "Ritual Time" is a useful handle for a slippery problem.

But do not mistake the map for the territory. The Braintrust worked not because of the rules of the room, but because of the people in it. We had candor because we loved each other enough to be hard on the work without being hard on the person. You call this "Ren." I simply call it checking your ego at the door. If you hand your "Minimum Viable Program" to a team that lacks that love, you will simply create a more sophisticated form of abuse.

The most valuable part of your essay is the "Cincinnatus Rule." The tendency for managers to become a priesthood—to fall in love with their own processes rather than the product—is the gravity that eventually pulls everything down. If your program can actually teach leaders to return to the plow, to disappear into the work rather than standing above it, then it is worth the risk.

It is a beautiful, terrifying piece of engineering. Use it with care.
