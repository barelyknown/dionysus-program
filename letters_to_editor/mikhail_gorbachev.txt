To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I read your section on Management Theater with a recognition that sits heavy in the chest. You describe the final years of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with clinical precision—the congresses, the plenums, the reports filled with successes while the shelves stood empty. You call it theater. We called it stability, until we called it stagnation, or zastoy. But you are correct. It was a ritual container that had lost its human contents.

I write to you as a man who attempted to raise the epimetabolic rate of a civilization that had forgotten how to metabolize anything.

When I came to power, the Soviet Union was the ultimate Apollonian structure. We had a plan for everything. We had eliminated variance. We had engineered society as a machine. But as you write, mechanistic thinking treats the human meaning as an externality. We had suppressed the Dionysian energy—the chaotic, creative, destructive force of life—for so long that our order had become necrosis.

I attempted to introduce the very tools you describe. Perestroika was an attempt at reconstitution. Glasnost was an attempt to enter Ritual Time—to create a standing right of criticism, to break the monopoly on truth, to let the melt happen so that we could forge something stronger. I wanted to turn our history from a frozen monolith into a tragic postmortem, where we could admit our hamartia—our fatal errors—and achieve catharsis without destroying the state.

My failure, and the lesson for your readers, lies in your concept of the Readiness Gate.

You write: Never build a ritual container larger than the shared humanity you have available to fill it. You warn that if you introduce high-intensity dissolution to a group held together only by payroll or fear, the atoms will scatter.

I opened the gate too wide, too fast. The Asabiyyah—the binding force—of the Soviet people had been eroded by seventy years of terror and cynicism. When I invited them to critique the assumptions of the state, they did not offer constructive criticism to improve the system. They did not attack the anti-scapegoat. They attacked the foundation itself, because there was no Ren, no trust left to hold the structure while the walls were being moved.

I was the steward who called for the Great Dissolution, believing we would re-charter and renew. Instead, I discovered that the priesthood—the nomenklatura—preferred the slow decline and the death spiral to the loss of their privileges. And the people, starved of beauty and truth for so long, did not want a new ritual. They wanted to burn the temple.

You Americans, and your corporate leaders, read this and think it is history. You think you are watching a documentary about a foreign land. Do not be so arrogant. I look at your institutions today—your political parties, your universities, your great corporations—and I see the same glazing of the eyes. I see the same frantic applause at the congress while the machinery rots. I see the same Oligarchic Decay, where the stewards of the rites protect their tenure rather than the mission.

You have mastered the technology of Apollo. You can land rockets. But you are forgetting how to die and be reborn.

The Dionysus Program is dangerous. It plays with fire. But I tell you from the ashes of an empire: the alternative to a controlled fire is not safety. The alternative is a wildfire that consumes everything, or a cold freeze that lasts forever.

We failed to mend what we broke. We could not hold the melt. I pray you have better luck.
