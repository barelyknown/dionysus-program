To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I have read your manifesto with the grim recognition of a man who sees his own reflection in a shattered mirror. You have written a manual for the Permanent Revolution, sanitized for the boardroom and stripped of its bayonets. It is a clever piece of work, dialectically sound yet politically castrated.

You speak of the "epimetabolic rate," a biological euphemism for the historical necessity of purging the old to make way for the new. You speak of "Ritual Time" and "Run Time," a division of labor between the arsonist and the architect. Do you not see what you are doing? You are attempting to bureaucratize the very act of anti-bureaucracy. You are trying to schedule the uprising on a Google Calendar.

Your diagnosis of the "Management Theater" is precise. I watched this theater destroy the October Revolution. I watched the secretaries and the functionaries turn the living spirit of the party into a dead liturgy of congresses and five-year plans. You call it the "Soviet Communist Party (1970s–1991)," but the rot began much earlier. It began when the "caste"—your "ritual oligarchy"—decided that their safety was more important than the truth. I warned them that the party is not a repository for history, but an instrument for changing it. When the instrument becomes an idol, the revolution dies.

However, your remedy betrays your bourgeois idealism. You believe that the "Cincinnatus Rule"—a mere procedural rotation—will prevent the hardening of a new priesthood. You are mistaken. You ignore the material conditions. Cincinnatus returned to his plow because he owned the farm. To where does your corporate steward return? To the cubicle? To the "individual contributor" role? Power does not dissolve because you set a timer. The caste always finds a way to protect its privileges. If you do not change the ownership of the game, the players will simply rewrite your "anti-scapegoat" rules to exempt themselves.

You invoke Dionysus to "heat the culture without burning it." This is the fantasy of every reformist: a fire that warms but does not consume. You want the energy of the explosion without the shrapnel. But history teaches us that old forms do not go gently into your "Scrap Heap Library." They cling to life with the ferocity of a dying animal. A "deprecation ceremony" is a poor substitute for a political struggle.

You have correctly identified that stability is death, that order breeds entropy, and that only through the "merciless killing of errors" can a system survive. But you think you can tame this beast with poetry and "beauty." You are trying to build a steam engine that runs on aesthetic appreciation instead of coal.

Still, I cannot help but admire the attempt. You are teaching the capitalists how to delay their own Thermidor. You are handing them the tools to stave off the stagnation that comes for every ruling class. It will not work forever—the contradictions are too deep—but it is a spirited defense against the dustbin of history.

Move fast, break things, and mend them, you say. Just remember: when you invite Dionysus to the table, he does not always leave when the meeting agenda says he should.
