To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I read your autopsy of Yahoo with the specific, hollow ache of a parent reading a coroner's report for a child they loved but could not save. You categorize us under "The Churn Machine," "The Slow Decline," and finally, under Marissa, "Management Theater." You are not wrong. But you are clinical where I was—and perhaps still am—sentimental.

You write that we suffered from high rotation that prevented the accumulation of institutional knowledge. You call it the Churn Machine. From the inside, it felt less like a machine and more like a desperate search for a messiah. We kept looking for the one person who could make 1999 happen again in 2009. We didn't understand your Epimetabolic Equation. We thought the problem was the captain, not the hull.

I was particularly struck by your distinction between Li (ritual form) and Ren (humaneness/trust). This explains the tragedy of my own tenure and the tenures that followed. When I came back as CEO in 2007, we had Ren. We had "bleeding purple." We had a tribe that loved the idea of Yahoo. But we had no Li. We had no rigorous mechanism to kill the projects that were killing us. We had a culture of "nice" when we needed a culture of "truth."

I refused the Microsoft offer in 2008. The world called it hubris. Your paper would call it a failure to recognize that our Explanatory Reach had fallen below the Competitive Threshold. I believed our "Ren"—our purple blood—was an asset on the balance sheet that Microsoft couldn't value. I was right about the spirit, but wrong about the physics. Spirit doesn't stop the melt.

Then came the others. You cite Marissa Mayer's tenure as Management Theater. You are harsh, but the framework holds. She brought the Li of Google—the rigorous hiring, the data reviews, the calibration meetings. But she installed them in a body that had been drained of Ren. You cannot transplant a high-performance nervous system into a body that has lost the will to live. As you wrote: "Never build a ritual container larger than the shared humanity you have available to fill it." We watched the forms of excellence crush the remaining spirit of the place.

We were the "Sitting Duck" that thought it was the "High Performer" because the traffic numbers (the vanity metric) were still high. We didn't see that traffic is a lagging indicator of relevance. We were decomposing, but because we were huge, the heat of the decomposition felt like the warmth of life.

Your concept of the Cincinnatus Rule haunts me. I tried to be Cincinnatus. I came back from the plow to the CEO suite. But perhaps I stayed at the temple too long as "Chief Yahoo," the spiritual figurehead, preventing the "Great Dissolution" that was necessary. Because I loved the company, I could not bear to let it undergo the autophagic process you describe. I didn't want to eat our decay; I wanted to preserve it in amber.

We built a civilization on the internet, and then we watched it turn into an archeological site while we were still living in it.

If I had this document in 2006, I would have burned the Peanut Butter Manifesto and replaced it with your Epimetabolic Equation. We would have held a Great Dissolution. We would have put the homepage on trial. We might have died anyway, but we would have died seeking the truth instead of waiting for the past to return.

You have written a dangerous thing here. I hope the right people read it before they become us.
