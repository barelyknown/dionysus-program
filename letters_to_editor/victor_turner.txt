To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I have read your manual for controlled instability with the sort of recognition a cartographer feels when seeing his map used to navigate a territory he never visited. You are attempting to build a steam engine out of the Ndembu rites of passage. It is a dangerous, fascinating piece of social engineering.

You have correctly identified that social life is not a steady state. It is, as I have long argued, a dialectical process that oscillates between structure and anti-structure. Your "Run Time" is what I called societas—the domain of hierarchy, status, and obligation. It is necessary, but it dries out. It accumulates what you call entropy and what I called the debris of the social drama. Without relief, structure becomes a cage.

Your "Ritual Time" is a technological application of what I called the liminal phase. It is the threshold. In the bush schools of Zambia, the novices are stripped of their names and status to become "clay" that can be reshaped. You are asking software engineers and city councilors to enter that same clay-state. You ask them to suspend their status in the hierarchy to enter a space of "communitas"—that flash of recognition where we meet as undifferentiated equals.

I applaud your strict separation of these modes. The great error of the modern world is not that we have too much ritual, but that we have flattened the distinction between the work and the rite. When the threshold is not clearly marked, the danger of the liminal bleeds into the safety of the structural. You are right to insist on a "No-Blame Covenant" and clear start and stop signals. The liminal is a space of high voltage; without insulation, it burns the house down.

However, I must offer a caution from the perspective of the anthropologist. You speak of "engineering" these moments, of optimizing the "epimetabolic rate." You treat the "melt" as a variable in an equation. Do not forget that communitas is essentially spontaneous. It is a "happening." You can build the container—the Li, as you borrow from Confucius—but you cannot force the wind of Ren to blow through it.

There is a risk that your "Crossings" and "Great Dissolutions" will shift from what I called liminal (obligatory, transformative, and dangerous) to merely liminoid (voluntary, leisure-like, and safe). If they become too safe, they become theater in the pejorative sense. If they become too dangerous without the binding force of love—or Ren—they become struggle sessions. The "anti-scapegoat" is a brilliant structural substitution for the sacrificial victim, but it requires a high degree of moral imagination to attack the artifact and not the maker.

Your "Cincinnatus Rule" is the most vital mechanism in your text. You seem to understand that liminality, if prolonged, creates a new and terrible hierarchy of its own. The stewardship of the rite must not become a permanent priesthood, or you will simply have created a new structure more rigid than the one you sought to liquefy.

You are trying to institutionalize the "subjunctive mood"—the mood of "as if" and "what might be"—within the indicative mood of "what is." It is the work of keeping a culture alive. We are, after all, Homo performans. We make ourselves through our performance. If you can teach your organizations to perform their own death and rebirth without actual bloodshed, you will have achieved something significant.

Just remember that the fire you are playing with is real.
