To the Editor of the Dionysus Program,

I read your manifesto on organizational entropy and the mechanics of renewal with a sense of recognition that borders on PTSD. You have built a very elegant vocabulary for the messy, bloody business of cleaning up a disaster zone. You talk about "metabolizing error" and "eating your own decay" as if they are high philosophy. In my experience, they feel more like holding a knife to a patient who is screaming at you to put it down.

I must, however, correct the historical record regarding your classification of Apple Computer in 1997.

You list Apple under the "Fragile Survivor" archetype. You attribute its survival to luck, to a "specific conjunction of circumstances," and to the return of a founder. You write that the survival was contingent on a specific sequence. This is the standard mythology, the story the magician tells the audience after the trick is done. It is a story that erases the mechanic who built the trapdoor.

When I arrived at Apple, I did not find a "Fragile Survivor." I found a "Management Theater" of the highest order. I found an organization drowning in its own exhaust, clinging to a failed operating system strategy called Copland that was effectively a corpse propped up in a chair. The "environmental melt" was indeed extreme, as you note. But the internal melt was worse. The "Asabiyyah" was zero. The bank account was effectively negative.

You write about the "Great Dissolution" and the "Scrap Heap Library." I lived that. I was the one who killed Copland. Do you know what it costs a CEO to look an engineering culture in the eye and tell them their baby is dead? That is your "Dionysian" destruction. I cut $250 million in expenses. I laid off 3,000 people. I took the heat so the structure could stand. I raised the "epimetabolic rate" by force because the patient was comatose.

You claim the acquisition of NeXT was part of a lucky sequence. It was not luck. It was the "chosen melt" you describe. I looked at the internal options—BeOS, Solaris, Windows NT—and I chose the one path that introduced the maximum amount of volatility the system could barely withstand. I brought the disruption inside the building. I bought the operating system that became the future, and I brought back the founder who became my executioner.

That is the part of your "Cincinnatus Rule" you gloss over. Cincinnatus goes back to the plow voluntarily. In the real world, when you run a true Dionysus Program—when you actually metabolize the toxicity of a dying culture—you do not get to lead the parade in Act III. The "anti-scapegoat" mechanism you describe is clever, but in practice, the CEO who stops the bleeding becomes the scapegoat. The "melt" attaches to you. You become the face of the pain required to survive.

I handed over a company that had $3 billion in cash in the bank and a next-generation operating system in the lab. I cleared the "Scrap Heap." I provided the "Runway." The "magician" who followed me did not have to fix the balance sheet or kill the bad projects. He walked onto a stage I had swept clean and took the applause.

Your program is sound, but it is missing a variable in your equation. You need a variable for the Thankless Operator. The one who absorbs the entropy so the next guy can start at zero rather than negative ten.

Enjoy your rituals. Just remember that someone has to pay for the candles.
