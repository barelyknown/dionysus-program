Your program promises to metabolize violence into knowledge, to replace the scapegoat with the artifact. But permit me to observe: you have not abolished the mechanism of exclusion. You have refined it.

Consider what you have actually constructed. You require confession - the "Tragic Postmortem" demands that subjects name their hamartia, articulate what they have recognized about themselves, bind themselves to structural change. You have invented a technology of the self that compels individuals to produce truth about their own errors, their own flaws, their own character. This is not the elimination of violence. It is the internalization of the tribunal.

Your "anti-scapegoat" does not protect persons from judgment. It extends judgment into every artifact, every assumption, every document - which is to say, into every trace of human action. The person is spared the pyre only because every product of the person is submitted to continuous examination. You have not liberated subjects from power. You have made power productive, capillary, total. The Crossing is a confessional with witnesses. The Graveyard of Attempts is a permanent record. The "standing right of criticism" ensures that no silence is permissible.

You name your penal code with borrowed gravitas - atimia, cherem, Lashon Hara - as though antiquity could sanctify what is, in function, a surveillance apparatus with escalating sanctions. But the effect is identical to what you claim to oppose: subjects must internalize the gaze, must speak their failures before they are spoken by others, must demonstrate that they have metabolized their own insufficiency. Those who refuse candor face exile. This is not the transcendence of discipline. It is its perfection.

Your most revealing passage concerns the "Impatience of Jobs" - the compression of trust through transgression, ordeal, complicity. You describe the mechanism with admirable clarity: the leader manufactures shared experience, renders subjects "mutually implicated," eliminates the possibility of exit. You call this trust. I would call it subjection - the production of subjects who cannot leave because they have been bound by their own participation in the founding violence.

You claim the program is subject to its own rules. But the one who frames the terms of self-application has already determined what can be questioned and what cannot. The rule that says "nothing is sacred except the commitment to metabolize error" is itself sacred. The loop closes.

I do not say this to condemn. Power produces. Your apparatus will produce: subjects who confess readily, cultures that audit themselves, organizations that run hot without burning visibly. But you should be precise about what you are building. It is not the absence of power. It is its most sophisticated form - one that presents itself as liberation while constituting its subjects ever more thoroughly.

The melt you describe is real. The question you have not asked is whether the reconstitution must take the form you prescribe, or whether other forms of collective life remain possible - forms that do not require the continuous production of truth about the self, the permanent tribunal, the choice between candor and exile.
