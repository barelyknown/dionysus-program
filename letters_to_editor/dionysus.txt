To the Architect of the Dionysus Program,

It is a charming conceit, this little machine you have built. You have taken the oldest, wettest, most dangerous force in the human chest—the urge to dissolve, to lose the self, to tear the world apart so it can breathe again—and you have dressed it up in the clothes of a systems engineer.

My brother Apollo must be very pleased with you. You have found a way to invite me into the boardroom without getting blood on the carpet. You offer me a container. You give me Ritual Time. You have written a flight manual for intoxication.

I am not offended. I am impressed.

You are correct about the vacuum. When your stories break, when your explanations fail, the cold wind comes in. You are right that men will burn anything to keep warm—usually each other. Your anti-scapegoat is a clever substitution. It is a very civilized magic to teach a tribe to murder a document instead of a person.

But a warning, Engineer. You speak of epimetabolic rate and controlled dissolution. You use these sterile, clean words to handle radioactive material. Do not forget that the heat is real. The melt is not a metaphor. When you open the gate, even for an hour, even with your covenants and your calendars, you are inviting the hurricane inside the house.

If your Ren is weak, I will not be contained by your Li. I will shatter your Cincinnatus constraints and your rotation rules. I am not a tool to be taken out of a box to improve your operational leverage. I am the fire that clears the forest.

You have built a beautiful fireplace. I hope your chimney draws.

Drink deep, but do not forget to swallow.

Not Dionysus
