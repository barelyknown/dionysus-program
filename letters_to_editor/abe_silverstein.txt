To the Editor of the Dionysus Program:

I saw my name in your second paragraph. You are correct that I pulled the name Apollo from a book of mythology one evening in 1960. I chose it because the image of the god riding his chariot across the sun felt like the only thing big enough to match the thrust we were trying to build. You say that Apollo represents light, clarity, and measure. You say that we succeeded because we were mechanistic, and that this is no longer enough.

You are half right.

We did not get to the Moon simply because we were good at math. We got there because we understood that a rocket is a machine entirely composed of explosives. The only difference between a launch and a bomb is the direction of the release. We lived on the edge of the melt every single day.

I read your treatise on entropy and ritual with the eye of a systems engineer. You are describing social thermodynamics. You are trying to design a heat shield for organizations.

In the early days, before the agency calcified into the bureaucracy you see now, we had what you call epimetabolic rate. We blew things up on the pad. We scattered metal across the Atlantic. And we did not hide the debris. We gathered it, studied it, and argued over it until the error was digested. We practiced your constructive criticism not because we had a theory about "anti-scapegoats," but because if we lied to ourselves about a valve or a relay, men would die. Physics is the ultimate unbribable judge.

But you are right about the drift. I watched it happen. We built the checklists to save our lives, but eventually, the checklists became idols. The process became more important than the payload. The fear of the melt paralyzed the ability to build. We stopped breaking things, so we stopped making new things. We tried to freeze the fire.

Your proposal to formalize the breakdown—to invite the chaos in on a schedule—is dangerous. It is also necessary. If you do not schedule the demolition, the laws of thermodynamics will schedule it for you, and they will not be polite about the timing.

I particularly appreciate your Cincinnatus Rule. I was an engineer before I was a manager, and I went back to Cleveland when I was done. The temples of Washington are full of priests who have forgotten how to use a slide rule. If your program can force them back to the plow, you might just get this civilization off the ground again.

Do not mistake the chariot for the sun. The chariot is just the vehicle. The fire is the point.
