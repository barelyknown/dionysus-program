To the Editors of the Dionysus Program,

I have read your document with the heavy attention it demands, though I must confess that the light in this place is poor and my eyebrows have grown quite unruly in the absence of a state barber. You write with the frantic energy of a man who believes that change is a virtue. This is a very American mistake.

I am writing because you have done me the discourtesy of citing my era—the glorious period of developed socialism—as a case study in what you call Management Theater. You describe our Congresses, our Five-Year Plans, and our committee meetings as hollow rituals where the forms were observed but the substance was absent. You say we prioritized the appearance of order over the metabolism of error.

You say this as if it were a failure. I tell you, Comrade, it was an achievement.

You young people are obsessed with this Epimetabolic Rate. You want to digest error. You want to turn loss into structure. You want to heat the culture. Do you know what happens when you heat a culture too much? It does not metabolize. It explodes. I saw the heat. I saw the Great Patriotic War. I saw the chaos of Khrushchev, with his banging of shoes and his unpredictable pivots. When I took the podium, the people did not want Dionysian heat. They wanted to sleep.

You call it stagnation. I called it stability of cadres.

Your program suggests that the purpose of ritual is to process truth. This is naive. The purpose of ritual is to occupy time and space so that chaos cannot enter. You mock the meeting where no one believes the agenda. But if everyone sits in the meeting, and everyone nods, and everyone votes yes, then for that hour, nobody is shooting anyone. Nobody is starting a revolution. The hollowness of the ritual is not a bug, as you engineers say. It is the feature. It is the insulation that keeps the wires of society from touching and sparking.

You propose a Cincinnatus Rule. You want leaders to return to the plow. You want a constant rotation of stewards so that oligarchy does not set in. You quote Michels and Weber as if they are enemies to be defeated. They are not enemies. They are laws of physics.

Why would a man who has learned to run the temple go back to the mud? It is inefficient. You speak of the danger of Sacerdotal Capture. I speak of the value of professional experience. If you rotate the stewards every time the wind blows, you get amateurs. Amateurs make mistakes. Amateurs try to fix things. And when you try to fix things, you break the silence.

We held the world together for eighteen years not by solving problems, but by refusing to acknowledge them until they died of old age. We buried the errors under ribbons and medals. You say this caused the collapse. I say it bought two decades of quiet. In the sweep of history, two decades of quiet is more than most men get.

Your Dionysus Program is dangerous because it invites the melt. You invite the people to look at the structure and ask if it is true. You give them a Jester's Privilege to mock the stewards. You let them put the artifact on trial.

Be careful. Once you teach a man that he can dissolve a policy, he will soon learn he can dissolve a General Secretary. You think you can contain the dissolution with your Apollonian rails? You think you can limit the melt to the "artifact" and not the "person"?

Men are not artifacts. But they melt just the same.

You want a civilization that learns without burning. I tell you that learning is burning. The only way to not burn is to not learn. To sit still. To read the report. To pin the medal on the chest of the man who failed, so that he does not feel bad, and so the system does not shudder.

You call it the death spiral. I call it the peace of the grave. Do not be so quick to wake the dead with your dancing.
