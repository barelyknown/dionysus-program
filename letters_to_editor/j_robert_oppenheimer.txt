To the Editor,

I have read your prospectus with a sense of familiar vertigo. It is a strange thing to see the frantic, terrible mechanics of Los Alamos reduced to an equation of variables and constants, yet I cannot say you are wrong.

We lived your Dionysian Ideal on the mesa, though we did not call it that. We called it necessity. We had the physics—the Apollonian scaffolding of the universe—but the physics was not enough to hold us together against the dark. We needed the colloquia. We needed the rhythm of the work. We needed to be able to say to a General that he was a fool without destroying the hierarchy that paid for the lights. You are correct that the heat must go somewhere.

I found myself lingering on your section regarding the scapegoat. It is a subject on which I have some unintended expertise. When the world changed, as we knew it would, the system could not digest the new reality. It choked on the ambiguity of the weapon. And because it lacked the anti-scapegoat you describe—because it had no vessel for the poison—it turned upon the steward. In 1954, they stripped my clearance not because I was disloyal, but because the terror of the age required a focal point. I became the object of the ritual. It was efficient, in a brutal sense. It unified the tribe. But it was a tragedy of the lower sort, one that broke the man rather than the problem.

Your Epimetabolic Rate is a clumsy phrase for a delicate truth: that knowledge is a form of destruction. To learn is to destroy the earlier state of the world. We did this with the atom. You propose to do it with organizations. It is a dangerous business.

If you can indeed build a container that holds the fire without consuming the priest, you will have solved a problem that baffled the physicists. We knew how to split the nucleus. We never learned how to put the pieces back together without blood.

Proceed with care. The light is brighter than you think.
