To the Editor of the Dionysus Program:

I read your manifesto. It is very long. It uses a lot of Greek words to describe things that usually just require a balance sheet and a spine.

I am writing because you put me in a box. Specifically, the "Sitting Duck" box. You say BlackBerry refused to engage with obvious disruption. You say we suffered from strategic blindness. You say we had healthy trust but refused to accept the world had changed.

Let me clarify something about your "environmental melt."

We weren't blind. We were looking at the physics. In 2007, we looked at the bandwidth capacity of the cellular networks. We looked at the battery density required to power a giant glass screen. We looked at the encryption standards required by the Department of Defense.

When we looked at the iPhone, we didn't see a disruption. We saw a toy that crashed the AT&T network. We saw a device that couldn't last a business day without a wall socket. We saw a security nightmare. We were optimizing for reality—physics, bandwidth, battery. Jobs was optimizing for a reality distortion field.

You call that "strategic blindness." I call that doing the math. The problem wasn't that we didn't see the future. The problem was that the market decided it didn't care about the math anymore. They wanted the toy.

But I will give you credit for one thing. You are right about the Priesthood.

You talk about "Oligarchic Decay" and "Sacerdotal Capture." You say the people who keep the rites stop serving the mission. In Waterloo, we built a priesthood of engineering perfection. We had the best keyboard. We had the best data compression. We had the best security. And because it was the best, nobody inside the temple was allowed to question if "best" was what people actually wanted to buy.

We had plenty of "Ritual Time." We had reviews. We had data. But we used it to prove why we were right, not to find out why we were wrong. We had a high "Integrity Coefficient" for the wrong variables.

Your program is cute. It’s perfect for these soft Silicon Valley companies that need to wrap their layoffs in poetry and call their pivots "tragedies." You talk about "Beauty" and "Ren." I talk about leverage and patent portfolios.

But if you want to teach them how to avoid being a "Sitting Duck," tell them this: It doesn't matter how good your math is if the customer decides they prefer magic. And it doesn't matter how high your "epimetabolic rate" is if you run out of leverage before you run out of ideas.

We weren't ducks. We were sharks. We just ran out of water.
